# Troubleshooting OpenShift problems
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro}

This section lists some troubleshooting advice.

## RHEL Subscription
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro-sub}

If you encounter a problem with your subscription, you can query by using the following command

```bash
subscription-manager list --available --all
```

## Load-balancer
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro-lb}

To check that load balancing is working, use the following command from the bastion node and it should return a full set of headers:

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate https://api.ocp.dallas.ibm.local:6443
```

## Red Hat CoreOS
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro-coreos}

There should be no need to SSH to node, but if you do, you can via the bastion node. The following example connects to the bootstrap server by using the following command:

```bash
ssh core@192.168.133.9
```

If you get an error, then try the following commands that disable the checking of the fingerprint:

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no core@192.168.133.9
```

This example shows how to connect to control-plane node from the bastion node to view the logs and change the permission to make them readable. The directory name might be different.

```bash
ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa core@192.168.133.12
sudo su
chmod 777 /var/log/pods/b2810e842791d83d48a4684295b7cd01/etcd-member/0.log
```

This example shows how to download the log to the bastion node and then on to the jump-server or remote device for readability and the ability to parse the logs. The directory name might be different.

```bash
scp -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa core@192.168.133.10:/var/log/pods/b2810e842791d83d48a4684295b7cd01/etcd-member/0.log 0.log
```

## OpenShift
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro-openshift}

Gets a list of nodes and their status:

```bash
oc get nodes
```

When using kubectl, there is a preference that takes effect while determining which kubeconfig file is used:

* use --kubeconfig flag, if specified.
* use KUBECONFIG environment variable, if specified.
* use $HOME/.kube/config file.

To export the kubeconfig created by the OpenShift Installer to an environment variable, use the following command:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/opt/ocp41install/auth/kubeconfig
```

## Deleting Deployment
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro-del}

If you encounter a problem with your terraform deployment, you can destroy your deployment with the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

In some cases, you might have issues with terraform to finish the automation. In these cases, you might need to delete your deployment manually by using vCenter and by deleting the terraform state files.

1. Remove folder "ocp" and its contents in vCenter
2. Remove resource group "ocp"
3. Remove terraform state file `rm /opt/ocp41install/installer/upi/vsphere/terraform.tfstate`

After these steps, you can fix your deployment issue and redeploy the OpenShift platform.

## Generating new ignition files
{: #openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro-newign}

Your ignition files are valid for 24 hours. You can generate the `.ign` files by completing the following steps:

1. Remove old state, configuration, and `ign` files:

```bash
cd /opt/ocp41install
rm -R .openshift_install.log .openshift_install_state.json auth *.ign metadata.json
```

2. Copy OpenShift install-config backup to yaml:

```bash
cp install-config.bak install-config.yaml
openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=/opt/ocp41install/
```

3. Copy bootstrap.ign to nginx home folder

```bash
cp bootstrap.ign /usr/share/nginx/html
```

4. Replace the master section (cat master.ign) and the worker section (cat worker.ign) in terraform.tfvars.

nano /opt/ocp41install/installer/upi/vsphere/terraform.tfvars

```bash
// Ignition config for the control plane machines. You should copy the contents of the master.ign generated by$
control_plane_ignition = <<END_OF_MASTER_IGNITION
<replace with new master.ign>
END_OF_MASTER_IGNITION

// Ignition config for the compute machines. You should copy the contents of the worker.ign generated by the i$
compute_ignition = <<END_OF_WORKER_IGNITION
<replace with new worker.ign>
END_OF_WORKER_IGNITION
```
