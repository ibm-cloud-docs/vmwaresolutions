# Interconnectivity overview
{: #interconnectivity-overview}

Interconnectivity consists of multiple services and offerings that enable customers to connect from their remote network locations to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} deployments and between workloads and services that run in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

It can be divided into the following categories:
- Interconnecting with on-premises networks
- Interconnecting VPCs and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services

The following diagram shows an overview of the interconnectivity solutions.

## Interconnecting VMware workloads with on-premises networks
{: #interconnectivity-onprem}

Interconnecting VMware workloads on VPC with on-premises networks provides the capability to know how to interconnect workloads with on-premises network.

The solution consists of the following key offerings:

- {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} offerings provide low-latency, high-throughput connections between {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} networks directly to a service provider-managed WAN, or a client-managed cloud backbone, or through a supported service provider.
- {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} can securely connect your virtual private cloud to another private network. This service offers two types of VPNs, such as Site-to-site gateways that connect your on-premises network to the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} network and Client-to-site servers that allows clients to connect to VPN servers on the internet.

See the following sections for more detailed overview for these offerings for on-premises connectivity, and architectural considerations when used with VMware workloads on VPC.

## Interconnecting VMware workloads with VPCs and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services
{: #interconnectivity-incloud}

Interconnecting workloads with VPCs and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services provides the capability to know how to interconnect VMware workloads that are running on a VPC with other workloads on other VPCs and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.

The solution consists of the following key offerings:

- {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}} provisions and defines connections between resources on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network, providing private interconnectivity between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers worldwide. You can connect {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure, and networks advertised over GRE tunnels on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure. You can also attach {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} to your {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}.
- With {{site.data.keyword.vpe_full}}, you can connect to supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services from your VPC network. To connect, you must use the IP addresses that you choose and that are allocated from a subnet within your VPC. You can use VPEs with your VMware workloads that run on VPC.

When you use the previous services, the data remains within the private {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} backbone and is optimized for performance.
