{{site.data.content.vrw-deprecated-note}}

Inside {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for VMware® Regulated Workloads, multiple levels of access are available. The automation uses a set of user IDs to perform operations such as adding hosts, clusters, or storage to your VMware instance.

## vCenter user IDs
{: #vrw-iam-vsphere-vcenter}

The following user IDs are used to add an identity source, which is embedded by default, into vCenter.

| User     | User ID      | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------------|:-------|:------------|
| Privileged user | `root` | SSH | Used for VMware configuration such as setting up VMware high availability and creating distributed switches. Used post deployment to pair primary and secondary vCenter Server instances. |
| IBM automation | `automation`@``root_domain`` \n (Active Directory user) | HTTPS | Used post deployment to add and remove hosts and clusters and to deploy and configure virtual machines (VMs) for add-on services. |
| Privileged user | `cloudadmin`@`root_domain` \n (Active Directory user) | HTTPS | Created for customer use only. |
