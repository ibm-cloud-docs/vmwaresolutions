# Operational tooling identity and access management
{: #vrw-iam-vrealize}



{{site.data.content.vrw-deprecated-note}}

## Overview
{: #vrw-iam-vrealize-overview}

The operational tooling consists of the following components:

* VMware Aria® Operations™ (formerly known as VMware vRealize® Operations Manager™) - Using data collected from objects in the VMware® platform, VMware Aria Operations uses detailed dashboards to show system health, capacity, and performance.
* VMware Aria Operations™ for Logs (formerly known as VMware vRealize® Log Insight™) - Objects in the VMware platform have been configured to send their logging events to VMware Aria Operations for Logs to enable a centralized log management function.

The following main principles or requirements for identity and access management to the operational tooling apply:
* The principle of least privilege to be used so that a user account is assigned only the privileges that are essential to perform the intended function.
* SaaS provider operations have full access to the operational tooling.
* `Auditor` has read-only access to the operational tooling.
* IC4V Active Directory (AD) is used to host accounts and define roles.

## Accounts
{: #vrw-iam-vrealize-accounts}

The following terminology is used to define the account types:

* User IDs - These IDs are assigned to people who require access to the system.
* Service IDs - These IDs are used by the IC4V automation or used by software components.
* Local IDs - These IDs are local to the application.
* SSH IDs - These IDs are used to access the Linux® VMs that host the applications.

## VMware Solutions infrastructure AD domain
{: #vrw-iam-vrealize-ad}
