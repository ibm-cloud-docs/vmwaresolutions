## Management cluster
{: #vrw-caveonix-management}

[Caveonix RiskForesight](https://cavhq.ai/){: external} provides a comprehensive cloud workload protection platform for {{site.data.keyword.rw}}. This platform delivers a common Risk Management Control Plane (RMCP) for continuous and proactive protection of management and edge workloads.

The RMCP enables the SaaS provider to maintain continuous and real-time visibility into workload deployments at scale, incorporating the most recent cyberthreats and regulatory compliance needs. RiskForesight also evaluates workload-specific cyberrisks and compliance risks and provides proactive defense by using agentless enforcement at network, security, and compute control planes of deployment.

RiskForesight’s unique Risk Management Control Plane (RMCP) interface slashes or eliminates needless security blind spots and compliance gaps, restoring risk visibility and confidence in compliant deployments.
