# Step 4 - Application setup
{: #caveonix-step4}

After the virtual machines (VMs) are deployed and the application components are installed, the Caveonix RiskForesight solution is available to be set up for the Service Provider and the first Tenant or Organization.

The Service Provider is the top-level organization and there are one or more Tenant/Organization serviced by the Service Provider. The Service Provider assigns Assets that are collected from vCenter to the Tenant or Organizations, who then assign them to Applications or Sub-applications. These Applications are then subject to a compliance regime.

This step is initially completed by the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} automation that uses information that is supplied by the client during the ordering process and default information. The setup process can be started by the client, post deployment, to modify the Service Provider or Tenant Organization as required post installation.

The Service Provider setup has eight substeps:
-	Step 1: Organization Detail - Add the details for the parent organization for your cloud service provider. This organization can have multiple physical locations and multiple data centers. Organizations for your tenants and sub-organizations for your service provider are added later.
-	Step 2: Locations – Map the infrastructure into RiskForesight "Locations”. The Assets are grouped by location, cloud provider, and asset repository.
-	Step 3: Environments - Optional. Environments are a way to group assets. For example, DevOps, DR Site, Production.
-	Step 4: Cloud Provider - Add the “providers” that provide the infrastructure that your application runs on.
-	Step 5: Asset Repositories - An Asset Repository associates a set of assets with an Organization, a Cloud Provider, and a Location.
-	Step 6: Organizations - Create sub-organization for your own operations and additional organizations - one for each of your service provider tenants. Each tenant must go through their own set-up process - including creating their own sub-organizations.
-	Step 7: Organization Users - Create and assign Users to Tenant Organizations and Sub-Organizations of the Service Provider.
-	Step 8: Task Scheduler – Configure tasks to; Synchronize with the Asset Repository, Perform SCAP Vulnerability and Compliance scans, Collect NSX network flows, Collect information about the software that is running on monitored Assets, Collect sys log and system events for Assets.

The Tenant or Organization Setup has seven substeps:

- Step 1: Organization - Add details for your primary organization. You can also create sub-organizations. Use organizations to segment your users, or as one of the ways to group your assets. You can create more organizations with one of your existing organizations as parent. When you create a new organization, you can select the **Business Impact Value**, which is used to generate cyber risk scores.
- Step 2: Organization Assets - New assets / workloads are automatically grouped by location, cloud provider, and asset repository. Assets can be assigned to only one organization at a time. The Service Provider needs to assign assets to an organization.
- Step 3: Associate Environment and Location – Optional. Environments are defined by the Service Provider.
- Step 4 and 5: Create Sub-Applications or Applications – Used to group assets across locations and organizations and see their associated flows and policies. Create applications that match business and IT services. For example, Application=SAP, Sub-Applications=SAP Front End, SAP Middle Tier, and SAP Back End. **Business Impact Value** corresponds to an Application, compliance regimes apply to an application.
- Step 6: Remote Access - Remote Access is required to run scans on assets, can be a default service account or an asset-specific account.
- Step 7: Task Scheduler - Schedule scans to run on a periodic basis. The types of tasks include; SCAP Scan-Vulnerability, SCAP Scan-XCCDF, NSX Flow Scan, Software Scan, Log Extract Scan.
