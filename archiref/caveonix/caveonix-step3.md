# Step 3 - Application configuration
{: #caveonix-step3}



This step uses the Caveonix RiskForesight™ configuration script. For the all-in-one deployment, this script is started through the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} automation.

For scaling, the client needs to call the script to provision the partially distributed topology or the fully distributed topology.

The script configures the following RiskForesight services:
- Caveonix Apps (API, Central Collector)
- Elastic Search
- PostgresSQL
- Remote Collector
- UI
- Kafka
- Kibana
- Certificates for all services

At the end of this step, the application components are installed on the required virtual machines.
