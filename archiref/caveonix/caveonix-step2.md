# Step 2 - Virtual machine deployment
{: #caveonix-step2}

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} automation requests an additional portable private IP subnet and the “all-in-one” virtual machine to be configured with an IP address from this subnet. 

Therefore, the Caveonix RiskForesight components can complete the following operations:
- Connect to vCenter and NSX Manager through the BCR.
- Connect to Remote Collectors, either on VXLANs or hosted off-premise.
- Allow the client to manage the IP address space when you scale up.
