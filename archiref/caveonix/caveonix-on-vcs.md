# Caveonix RiskForesight use cases and benefits
{: #caveonix-on-vcs}

Caveonix RiskForesight provides an automated deployment of the Caveonix RiskForesight solution in an “all-in-one” virtual machine (VM) deployment. It is initially configured with a Service Provider and a Tenant and integrated into vCenter and NSX Manager. The Asset Repository is populated with the VMware® vCenter Server infrastructure components and an Application and Sub-Application, which represent the VMware infrastructure platform, are configured. On the dashboard, the cyberrisk scores, compliance risk scores, and compliance reports for the required compliance regimes are available.

The following list is an overview of the initial workflows:
1. Client orders the service and initiates an automated installation of the RiskForesight Application.
2. Service Provider data is configured.
3. Tenant Organization and Assets are initially configured through vCenter. An Application and Sub-Application is configured for the vCenter Server® instance.
4. Dashboards are populated for the tenant to manage their cyberrisk and compliance posture:
    - Compliance Management
    - Risk Management
    - Forensics Management
5. Client installs Remote Collectors.
6. Client can also use RiskForesight to manage their on-premises data center.

## Use cases
{: #caveonix-on-vcs-use-cases}

The following examples are typical use cases:
- Customer wants to determine whether their infrastructure and workloads are meeting compliance requirements.
- Customer wants to assess their potential cyberrisk and compliance impact on their workloads and how to mitigate.
- Customer wants to gain visibility and determine the changes in their hybrid cloud environment.
- Customer wants to proactively manage overall risks within hybrid cloud before they can be used to reduce breaches.
- Customer wants to identify specific actions to eliminate risks due to cyberthreats, vulnerabilities, or non-compliant configurations.
- Customer wants to achieve faster time to detection with machine learning by analyzing volumes of data to understand good behavior and identify anomalies.
- Customer wants to reduce overall compliance costs due to automated controls and assessments.
- Customer wants to eliminate blind spots by viewing multi-dimensional grouping of assets across each location, organization, and application group in hybrid cloud.
-	Customer wants to build and enforce security and compliance policies based on predictive analytics engine that uses network traffic flows across all applications.

## Key benefits to customers
{: #caveonix-on-vcs-benefits}

The key benefits that are provided by Caveonix RiskForesight include:
- Eliminating blind spots, by viewing multi-dimensional grouping of assets across each location, organization, and application group in hybrid cloud.
- Building and enforcing security and compliance policies based on predictive analytics engine that uses network traffic flows across all applications.
- Quickly identifying required actions to eliminate risks due to cyberthreats, vulnerabilities, or non-compliant configurations.
- Proactively managing the overall risks within hybrid cloud before they can be used.
- Maintaining a “full-stack” understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements.
- Enabling the enterprise to implement the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proactive Risk Management Framework.
