# Caveonix RiskForesight use cases and benefits
{: #caveonix-on-vcs}

Caveonix RiskForesight™ provides an automated deployment of the Caveonix RiskForesight solution in an all-in-one virtual machine (VM) deployment. It is initially configured with a Service Provider and a Tenant and integrated into vCenter and NSX Manager. The Asset Repository is populated with the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} infrastructure components and an Application and Sub-Application, which represent the VMware infrastructure platform, are configured. On the dashboard, the cyberrisk scores, compliance risk scores, and compliance reports for the required compliance regimes are available.

The following list is an overview of the initial workflows:
1. The client orders the service and initiates an automated installation of the RiskForesight Application.
2. The service provider data is configured.
3. The tenant organization and assets are initially configured through vCenter. An Application and Sub-Application is configured for the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instance.
4. The dashboards are populated for the tenant to manage their cyberrisk and compliance posture:
    - Compliance Management
    - Risk Management
    - Forensics Management
5. The client installs Remote Collectors.
6. The client can also use RiskForesight to manage their on-premises data center.

## Use cases
{: #caveonix-on-vcs-use-cases}

The following examples are typical use cases:
- Determine whether the infrastructure and workloads are meeting compliance requirements.
- Assess the potential cyberrisk and compliance impact on workloads and how to mitigate.
- Review and determine the changes in the hybrid cloud environment.
- Proactively manage overall risks within the hybrid cloud to reduce breaches.
- Identify specific actions to eliminate risks due to cyberthreats, vulnerabilities, or noncompliant configurations.
- Achieve faster time to detection with machine learning by analyzing volumes of data to understand good behavior and identify anomalies.
- Reduce overall compliance costs due to automated controls and assessments.
- Eliminate blind spots by viewing a multidimensional grouping of assets across each location, organization, and application group in the hybrid cloud.
- Build and enforce security and compliance policies based on predictive analytics engine that uses network traffic flows across all applications.

## Key benefits to customers
{: #caveonix-on-vcs-benefits}

The key benefits that are provided by Caveonix RiskForesight include:
- Eliminating blind spots, by viewing multidimensional grouping of assets across each location, organization, and application group in hybrid cloud.
- Building and enforcing security and compliance policies based on predictive analytics engine that uses network traffic flows across all applications.
- Quickly identifying required actions to eliminate risks due to cyberthreats, vulnerabilities, or noncompliant configurations.
- Proactively managing the overall risks within the hybrid cloud before they can be used.
- Maintaining a “full-stack” understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements.
- Enabling the enterprise to implement the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proactive Risk Management Framework.
