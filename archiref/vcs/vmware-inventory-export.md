# How to export the VMware inventory?
{: #vmware-inventory-export}
{: faq}

You can export a VMware vCenter Server® resource inventory into CSV files. The information in the exported CSV files is used to size a target VMware vCenter Server environment. It can also provide insights to the virtual machines in the source environment to help with migration planning.

## How to export the contents of an inventory list into a CSV file?
{: #export-procedure}
{: faq}

You can export the contents of an inventory list into a CSV file through following steps:

1. From the VMware vSphere® Web Client, open a list view for an object type, for example, **Virtual Machines** or **Hosts**.
   You can access list views of objects from the Global Inventory Lists and the search results.
2. Click the **Export** icon in the lower right of a **Global Inventory** or **Resources list** view. To open the navigator view, press `CTRL+ALT+7`.
3. Select each row to be listed in the CSV file for each of the following sections:
    - Global Inventory Lists > Virtual Machines
    - Resources > vCenter Servers
    - Resources > Datacenters
    - Resources > Hosts
    - Resources > Clusters
    - Resources > Resource Pools
    - Resources > Datastores
    - Resources > Datastore Clusters
    - Resources > Networks
    - Resources > Distributed Port Groups
    - Resources > Distributed Switches
4. For each of the previous items, click **Export** and save to a file name that is labeled with the contents, such as:
    - Global Inventory Lists > Virtual Machines
    - Resources > vCenter Servers > `exportlist-vcenters.csv`
    - Resources > Datacenters > `exportlist-datacenters.csv`
    - Resources > Hosts > `exportlist-hosts.csv`
    - Resources > Clusters > `exportlist-clusters.csv`
    - Resources > Resource Pools > `exportlist-respools.csv`
    - Resources > Datastores > `exportlist-datastores.csv`
    - Resources > Datastore Clusters > `exportlist-dsclusters.csv`
    - Resources > Networks > `exportlist-networks.csv`
    - Resources > Distributed Port Groups > `exportlist-dpgs.csv`
    - Resources > Distributed Switches > `exportlist-dswitches.csv`
5. Package all `.csv` files into a single compressed file. For example, `vCenterName-Inventory.zip`.
6. Use the contents of the file to size the target environment.
