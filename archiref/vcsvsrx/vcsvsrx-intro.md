# Juniper Networks vSRX deployment and operation with {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}}
{: #vcsvsrx-intro}



This information is intended for the deployment and operations of a high availability vSRX cluster as the gateway for the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}}. The guide follows best practices as currently accepted and understood.

Currently, the vSRX is only available as an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure offering. Orders are placed from the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/network/gatewayappliances), Networking, Gateway Appliances section.

Initial deployment consists of two bare metal hosts with KVM as the hypervisor and a single vSRX node as the only workload on each host. These items form the high-availability vSRX cluster.

The vSRX cluster must be ordered as noted previously, so the gateway role is assigned to the cluster.
