# IBM Cloud optional services considerations
{: #v2t-optionalservices}

It is important to understand that any add-on services that you are using in your NSX-V environment are related to that instance. These services are deleted when the NSX-V environment is deprovisioned.

The following list provides the services that you might currently use:

* [Caveonix RiskForesight](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-caveonix_considerations)
* [F5 BIG-IP](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-f5_considerations)
* [VMware HCX](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-hcx_considerations)
* [Entrust CloudControl](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-htcc_considerations)
* [Entrust DataControl](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-htdc_considerations)
* [Juniper vSRX](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-juniper-overview)
* [Red Hat OpenShift for VMware](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_overview)
* [Veeam](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeamvm_overview)
* [vRealize Operations and Log Insight](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vrops_overview)
* [Zerto](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-addingzertodr)

You need to plan to migrate these services to new services on the NSX-T environment.

## Understanding metadata
{: #v2t-optionalservices-metadata}

Optional services can be decoupled from the vCenter Server with NSX-V instance and reused with vCenter Server with NSX-V instance. However, it is important to understand the metadata that the service is using from vCenter Server. 

Review the following information for Advanced Cross vCenter Server vMotion.

* MAC-Address stays the same.
* vCenter's MoRef ID for the VM changes. MoRef ID is a unique ID inside vCenter for every object. A MoRef ID is only unique within a vCenter Server.
* InstanceUUID stays the same. InstanceUUID is generated by the respective vCenter. However, it is preserved across vMotions that occur within the same SSO domain and across an SSO domain.

## Veeam
{: #v2t-optionalservices-veeam}

It is possible to decouple your Veeam instance from your vCenter Server with NSX-V instance for reuse with your vCenter Server with NSX-T instance. Configure Veeam to point to the vCenter Server associated with the NSX-T environment. 

You must open a ticket to ask IBM Support to decouple the Veeam server, management subnet, and any associated iSCSI storage from the vCenter Server with NSX-V instance so that these components are not deleted when the NSX-V instance is cancelled.
{: important}

If you deploy a new Veeam instance, you must consider backup data and backup configuration to migrate Veeam to the new NSX-T instance.

* Backup data - Backup files will be hosted in the Veeam repository server. For more information, see [Importing Veeam Agent backups](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforwindows/userguide/integration_import.html?ver=50){: external}.
* Backup config - The backup configuration can be saved to a file. For more information, see [Configuration backup and restore](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/vbr_config.html?ver=110){: external}.


## Caveonix RiskForesight
{: #v2t-optionalservices-caveonix}

The primary use case for Caveonix RiskForesight is the compliance reporting of the VMware® environment. Therefore, data migration from the NSX-V Caveonix RiskForesight instance to the NSX-T Caveonix RiskForesight instance is not needed.

A secondary use case for Caveonix RiskForesight is the compliance reporting of the workload VMs hosted on the VMware environment. In this case, compliance data for the workload VMs must be migrated to the NSX-T Caveonix RiskForesight instance. You must engage with IBM and Caveonix to plan this migration.

## VMware HCX
{: #v2t-optionalservices-hcx}

HCX is not being used for DR services, and so no HCX migration to the NSX-T instance is expected. HCX can be used as a migration tool. In this case, the NSX-T instance must be ordered with HCX.

## Zerto
{: #v2t-optionalservices-zerto}

It is recommended that Zerto is deployed with the vCenter Server with NSX-T instance and that new site pairing is configured along with the required protection configuration. 

## IBM Spectrum Protect Plus
{: #v2t-optionalservices-spp}

IBM Spectrum Protect Plus is not currently available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances. Consider the usage of Veeam instead.

## FortiGate Virtual Appliance
{: #v2t-optionalservices-fortigate}

FortiGate Virtual Appliance is available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances.

* No migration is required for FortiGate Virtual Appliance.
* Capture existing NSX-V FortiGate Virtual Appliance configuration.
* Provision NSX-T vCenter Server with FortiGate Virtual Appliance service.
* Configure NSX-T FortiGate Virtual Appliance.
* Cut-over to the NSX-T FortiGate Virtual Appliance at the required point in the migration.

## Entrust CloudControl
{: #v2t-optionalservices-cc}

Entrust CloudControl is available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances.

If a migration is required, review the following information.

* Entrust can provide a CloudControl Migration tool. Contact the Entrust Professional Services at `HTCC-Migration@hytrust.com`
* Entrust Professional Services are not required to use the migration tool. However, Entrust highly recommends that you use their Professional Services for a preemptive HealthCheck of the existing CloudControl installation.

## Entrust DataControl
{: #v2t-optionalservices-dc}

Entrust DataControl is not currently available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances.

## Entrust KeyControl
{: #v2t-optionalservices-kc}

Entrust KeyControl is no longer available in IBM Cloud. Investigate alternative solutions and implement.

## F5 BIG-IP
{: #v2t-optionalservices-f5}

F5 BIG-IP is available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances. The migration approach is to configure F5 BIG-IP in the NSX-T environment in parallel to the existing NSX-V configuration to allow testing. After verification, cut-over to NSX-T F5 BIG-IP appliances.

## Juniper vSRX
{: #v2t-optionalservices-vsrx}

Juniper vSRX is available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances. In the vCenter Server NSX-V instance, the Juniper vSRX virtual appliance might be deployed:

* On the consolidated or management cluster - The Juniper vSRX protects the traffic to your workload VMs.
* On the edge services cluster - The Juniper vSRX appliances protects the vSphere hosts and the workload VMs in the same data center PoD.

The migration approach would be to:

* Provision vCenter Server with NSX-T with the required Juniper vSRX service option.
* Capture the NSX-V environment Juniper vSRX appliance configuration information.
* Manually extract the required configuration settings that need to be transferred to the NSX-T environment Juniper vSRX appliances.


## Red Hat OpenShift for VMware
{: #v2t-optionalservices-ocp}

Red Hat OpenShift for VMware for NSX-T is available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances. The migration approach summary is as follows:

* Provision the vCenter Server with NSX-T instance with Red Hat OpenShift for VMware.
* Configure the new Red Hat OpenShift for VMware cluster as required.
* Create a migration plan, which includes how to handle data from the applications that are being migrated.
* Consider the use of Migration Toolkit for Containers. 

## vRealize Operations and Log Insight
{: #v2t-optionalservices-vropsvli}

vRealize Operations and Log Insight is available for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances.

The primary use case for vRealize Operations and Log Insight is to capture performance, capacity, and logging messages for the vCenter Server instance. A secondary use case is to capture performance, capacity, and logging messages for the workload VMs hosted on the vCenter Server instance.

The migration approach for the primary use case would be to:

* Provision vCenter Server with NSX-T with the vRealize Operations and Log Insight service.
* No performance, capacity, or log messages for the NSX-V instance components need to be retained as the instance will be deleted.
* When the vCenter Server with NSX-V is deleted, the vRealize Operations and Log Insight service will also be deleted.
* Migrate the content of the vCenter Server with NSX-V vRealize Operations Manager to vRealize Operations Manager to vCenter Server with NSX-T following VMware documentation.
