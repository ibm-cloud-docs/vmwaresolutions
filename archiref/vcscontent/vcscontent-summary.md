# Stock Trader summary

Todd and Jane significantly enhanced the functions of Stock Trader, how it is developed and managed, and how portable, flexible, and scalable it is.

They can now add any capability they code without fear of dependencies, lock-in to where Stock Trader can run, or delays due to resource constraints.
