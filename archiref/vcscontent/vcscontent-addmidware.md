# Refactor and add middleware into IBM Cloud Private
{: #vcscontent-addmidware}

Now that Stock Trader is running in a container, and Jane is satisfied with the current micro-services, she and Todd work on how to enhance the application with extra capabilities. By refactoring Stock Trader micro-services to handle increased activity and scalability, they both see the need to add middleware into {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Private. Some of the middleware existed in their data center, so it becomes more of a replatform exercise with some new middleware added.

This refactoring of the solution brings a common platform to run the application and the required services, bringing in a simpler management plane.

For Stock Trader, based on Jane’s solution architecture, Todd is going to start with [Db2](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2-hosted), [MQ](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/mq), and [Redis](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/databases-for-redis).

## Adding middleware
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-add-middleware}

To add middleware into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, find the helm chart in the catalog, read the readme file, then continue to install.

For Stock Trader, Todd decided to add all of the middleware. The following information summarizes what Todd had to perform for each middleware he wanted Jane to use.

### Db2
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-db2}

Todd starts with Db2 because they're already using Db2 and can dedicate a container-based Db2 for each solution.

Since Todd prepared {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}}, he already has his pod security policy defined. Todd can focus on creating a docker image pull secret:

`kubectl create secret docker-registry db2dockerregistry
--docker-username=dockeruser
--docker-password=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX
--docker-email=dockeruser@email.com --namespace=default`

Finally, since Todd decided to use NFS, he created NFS volumes based on the readme file requirements:

Go to {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} dashboard and create Persistent Volume. How large? Look in the readme file to find out:

`capacity=20Gi
RWO
type=NFS
server = nfs.server.ip.address
path = /shared/db2trader1`

In the catalog user interface, search for “Db2” and click ibm-db2oldp-dev. Review the readme file then click Configure.

In the Configure section, there's a Quick Start section and an All Parameters section. Open the All Parameters since Todd needs to enter more configuration:

*	Release name = db2trader1
*	namespace = default
*	agree to license
*	database name = trader
*	secret name = db2dockerregistry
*	service name = db2trader1-ibm-db2oltp-dev
*	service type = NodePort
*	Port = 50000
*	db2 instance name = db2inst1
*	pw for db2 instance name = xxxxxx
*	Yes (check) Enable persistence for this deployment

After Db2 is running, Todd or Jane needs to create the tables that the Stock Trader solution uses.

### MQ
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-mq}

Todd and Jane need messaging software, and since they already use MQ, this is a great option. Also, it can run in a small footprint, and
the dev version can be spun up for each Developer, saving precious Production traffic. Installing MQ is fairly simple. Todd creates the storage just like he did with Db2, and then installs the helm chart:

{{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} Dashboard > Catalog > start to type in MQ > select ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev Review the readme file then click Configure Provide or verify the following input values:

`release name = mqtrader1
target namespace = stock-trader
accept license
enable persistence
data PVC size = 2Gi
Service type = NodePort
Queue manager name = stocktrader
Admin pw = mq1pw
App password = LEAVE BLANK`

Initially Todd selects NodePort to get at the middleware from the user interface. Eventually, Todd can use ClusterIP so only pods inside the cluster can get to the middleware.

To configure MQ to use Stock Trader, Todd opens the MQ Management user interface, which is the exact same as the VM version.

### Redis
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-redis}

Even though Stock Trader is running on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Hosted, they are still worried about the stock quote service latency when all they really care about is the end of previous day stock for most of their work. To help improve performance, they add a Redis cache.

This deployment uses the ibm-redis-ha-dev chart from ibm-charts.

By default, this chart installs six pods: one master, two slaves, and three sentinels. This is a great example of resilience in Kubernetes where more than one pod works together across many worker nodes, even when the worker nodes are in more than one subnet.

The configuration is simple, so Todd enters which namespace to install it into, and begins the installation.

## Refactor Stock Trader
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-refactor-stock-trader}

Refactoring Stock Trader is an important step for Jane. While Todd was busy adding the middleware into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, Jane refactored her solution to optimized it for Kubernetes and cloud behaviors.

For example, when Jane transformed Stock Trader, she took the .war files and added each one into a Liberty container but used the WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment configuration to point to the data source. It was a good start and Jane's application gets value out of Kubernetes scheduling and orchestration immediately.

Many other benefits exist from optimizing Jane's micro-services (recode
and build) for the Kubernetes world.

To optimize, Jane took the following steps:
-	Updated her code in her code repo (Jane used GitHub Enterprise)
-	Added a pipeline (Jane used Jenkins)
-	Built by using Maven

The following example shows Jane's [code repository](https://github.com/IBMStockTrader/), along with the Jenkins file, server.xml, and more. With this in place, Jane can freely code extra capabilities via secrets to access services like ODM and Watson, along with more micro-services as individual repositories in GitHub.

### Adding secrets
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-add-secrets}

Now that Jane refactored the Stock Trader micro-services, she requires a way to abstract the service names, user IDs, and passwords, so that her application can pick up unique details about the service when deployed without hardcoding specific names and rebuilding the application.

Using Kubernetes secrets, Jane configures a well-defined secret name and parameters within each secret to ensure that when the micro-service is deployed it picks up the unique host name, user ID, password, or any other sensitive credentials, making her application portable.

Jane wants a unified code base, even when Stock Trader might run on more than one cloud. The secret DB2 in the following figure has different routing details but in the same format. When Jane's portfolio micro-service deploys, it looks for the DB2 secret endpoint parameter to connect to the appropriate Db2 instance. The Stock Trader application doesn't care if it's running in a VMware virtual machine, a containerized service, or as a cloud-managed service.

## Result
{: #vcscontent-addmidware-result}

Because Jane committed to refactoring her Stock Trader solution, and Todd installing middleware into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Hosted, all of the core Stock Trader solution is running in a private cloud. Jane now adds more micro-services such a Twitter notification service. Istio routing rules enable dynamic loyalty level messaging via an internal Slack channel or a public Twitter channel.
