# Configuring the Veeam backup server
{: #veeam-cr-sag-vbrcfg}

For the immutable backup and isolated recovery environments, the Veeam速 backup server is configured by PowerShell. PowerShell is run locally on the Veeam backup server through an Ansible速 playbook that is run on the automation server. Ansible uses WinRM to access Microsoft速 Windows速 servers. The following items are required by Ansible:

* PowerShell 3.0 or newer and at least .NET 4.0 to be installed.
* A WinRM listener that is created and activated.

Both these requirements are enabled by default in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} build of Windows 2019.

In this step, the following tasks are required to configure the Veeam backup server so that it can be accessed by the automation server:

* [Create a firewall rule](#veeam-cr-sag-vbrcfg-fw) that allows WinRM inbound on TCP port `5986`.
* [Create a service account for ansible automation](#veeam-cr-sag-vbrcfg-sa), and add to the local administrator group.

## Creating an inbound firewall rule
{: #veeam-cr-sag-vbrcfg-fw}

1. From the jump server, use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client to access the Veeam backup server.
2. On the Veeam backup server, open a PowerShell window with "Run as administrator" option.
3. Run the following command `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WinRM (HTTPS-In)" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5986` to create the required firewall rule.

## Creating a service account for ansible automation
{: #veeam-cr-sag-vbrcfg-sa}

1. From the jump server, use the RDP client to access the Veeam backup server.
2. On the Veeam backup server, open a PowerShell window with "Run as administrator" option.
3. Use the following commands and enter a password at the prompt:

   ```text
   $n = "sa-ansible"
   $d = "Service Account for ansible control node"
   $pw = Read-Host -AsSecureString
   New-LocalUser -AccountNeverExpires -Description $d -Name $n -Password $pw -PasswordNeverExpires -Confirm:$false
   Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member $n
   ```
   {: codeblock}

4. Verify with `Get-LocalUser` and `Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"`.
