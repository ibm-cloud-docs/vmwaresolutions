# Instant restore
{: #veeam-cr-sag-instantrestore}



This document describes a use case where a cyberadmin uses a PowerShell script that uses Veeam®'s ability to do an instant restore of a production virtual machine (VM) from the cyberbackup.

Veeam's instant restore feature enables a VM to be started directly from the backup files. Veeam® vPower NFS service is used to access the backup files.

The script completes the following tasks:

* Runs from a PowerShell window on the Veeam backup server, or a PowerShell window on a different server where the Veeam PowerShell extension is installed. The Veeam backup server is also enabled for PowerShell remoting.
* Requires the following variables:
   * VM name `<vm_name>` from vCenter and the network name `<src_nw_name>` that the VM is connected to.
   * The VMware ESXi™ hostname `<esxi_hostname>` where the VM is restored.
   * A resource pool name `<resource_pool_name>` to which the restored VM belongs to.
   * The datastore `<datastore_name>` where the backup is restored.
   * A folder name `<folder_name>` in vCenter to which the restored VM belongs to.
   * The name of the target network `<tgt_nw_name>` that the restored VM is connected to.
* Retrieves the most recent retention point of the VM to be restored.
* Defines the restored VM name with a suffix of CR followed by a timestamp.
* Defines a description of the restore in the variable `$Reason`.
* Restores the VM:
   * The restored VM is powered on.
   * The PowerShell command is run asynchronously as the restore is a long-running process.
   * An anti-virus scan is initiated for Windows® OS and continues to scan after the first virus threat is found. If a virus is detected, the network on the VM is disabled.
* At the end of the instant restore, the VM is left powered on.

To find the VM names in the backup job, the following command can be used in a PowerShell window, where the JobName is set to a name of a Backup Job. In this example, the backup job is named `Cyber-backup - 1d1w30rp`:

```text
$JobName = "Cyber-backup - 1d1w30rp"
Get-VBRJob -Name $JobName | Get-VBRJobObject | Select-Object -Property Name
```
{: codeblock}

The following example shows some sample variables.

```text
$VMName           = "nrt01"
$SrcNetworkName   = "192-168-3-0-24"
$EsxiHostname     = "host002.test.ibmcloud.local"
$ResourcePoolName = "Cyber-restore-rp"
$DatastoreName    = "workload_share_LkXB6"
$FolderName       = "Cyber-restore"
$TgtNetworkName   = "cyber-veeam-recovery"
```
{: codeblock}

The PowerShell script is shown in the following example.

```text
# VM variables
$VMName = "<vm_name>"
$SrcNetworkName = "<src_nw_name>"

# Restore variables
$EsxiHostname = "<esxi_hostname>"
$ResourcePoolName = "<resource_pool_name>"
$DatastoreName = "<datastore_name>"
$FolderName = "<folder_name>"
$TgtNetworkName = "<tgt_nw_name>"

# Conversions
$LastRestorePoint = Get-VBRRestorePoint -Name $VMName | Sort-Object -Property CreationTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
$Esxi = Get-VBRServer -Type ESXi -Name $EsxiHostname
$ResourcePool = Find-VBRViResourcePool -Server $Esxi -Name $ResourcePoolName
$Datastore = Find-VBRViDatastore -Server $Esxi -Name $DatastoreName
$Folder = Find-VBRViFolder -Server $Esxi -Name $FolderName
$SrcNetwork = Get-VBRViServerNetworkInfo -Server $Esxi | Where-Object { $_.NetworkName -eq $SrcNetworkName }
$TgtNetwork = Get-VBRViServerNetworkInfo -Server $Esxi | Where-Object { $_.NetworkName -eq $TgtNetworkName }
$RestorePointDate = $LastRestorePoint.CreationTime
$RestoreDate = Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd-HH:mm
$Reason = "Cyber-restore of $VMName retention point: $RestorePointDate at $RestoreDate"
$RestoredVMName = "$VMName-CR-$RestoreDate"

# Instant restore
Start-VBRInstantRecovery -RestorePoint $LastRestorePoint -Server $Esxi -ResourcePool $ResourcePool -Datastore $Datastore -Folder $Folder -SourceNetwork $SrcNetwork -TargetNetwork $TgtNetwork -VMName $RestoredVMName -PowerUp:$True -Reason $Reason -RunAsync -EnableAntivirusScan -EnableEntireVolumeScan -VirusDetectionAction DisableNetwork
```
{: codeblock}

## Log
{: #veeam-cr-sag-instantrestore-logs}

The following PowerShell commands display the log entries of the last restore session for the VM `<vm_name>`:

```text
$VMName = "<vm_name>"
$Session = Get-VBRRestoreSession -Name $VMName | Sort-Object -Property CreationTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
$Logs = $Session.logger.GetLog().GetRecordsSortedByOrdinalId()
foreach ($Log in $Logs) { Write-Host $Log.Title }
```
{: codeblock}

The following example shows the log entries for a VM called `nrt01`. The antivirus scan was skipped for this Linux® VM.

```text
Skipping nrt01: operating system is not supported for antivirus scan
Starting nrt01-CR-2021-11-19-12:50 recovery

{: codeblock}

On the Linux hardened repository, the following ports were temporarily opened on the Linux firewall designated by the comment `Veeam rule 876f0752-7209-4e8b-8b34-fa0af7dbced4`.

```text

## Stopping the instant recovery
{: #veeam-cr-sag-instantrestore-stop}

The instant recovery session can be stopped by using the following command `Get-VBRInstantRecovery | Where-Object {$_.VMName -eq $RestoredVMName} | Stop-VBRInstantRecovery`.

For a use case where a cyberadmin uses the Veeam data integration API to access the cyberbackup, see [Creating a Veeam Linux managed server](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sag-lnxmgdsvr).
