# Port access requirements for VMware HCX
{: #hcx-archi-port-req}

VMware® HCX™ must traverse the public internet and private lines, and connect to data center components, such as networks, switches, and port groups.

The following table lists ports that must be opened so that Hybrid Cloud Services virtual appliances can install successfully. Both the vSphere environment and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} environment must allow Network Time Protocol (NTP) clock synchronization among vSphere on-premises devices and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} devices. UDP port 123 must be accessible to Hybrid Cloud Services virtual appliances and networks. Installed NTP Servers can be specified when the Hybrid Cloud Services Appliance is installed.
