# VMware NSX-T logical routers on VPC deployments
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers}

A single VMware NSX-Tâ„¢ edge services cluster with two virtual edge nodes is used in this architecture. You must create a Tier-0 (T0) logical router or a Tier-1 (T1) router to provide stateful services, such as NAT or load balancer.

In this architecture, the single edge services cluster hosts both T0 and T1s. For more information about edge cluster deployment, see [CF NSX-T design on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-vcf-nsx-t).

## Tier-0 logical router
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers-edge-tier-0}

An NSX-T Tier-0 logical gateway provides a gateway service between the logical NSX-T overlay segments and VPC subnets, for example, for north-south traffic. In this architecture, a highly available T0 gateway is deployed in the NSX-T edge services cluster. Because of a VMware NSX-T limitation, this edge services cluster can host only a single T0 Logical Router, which runs in Active-Standby mode. Active-Standby mode is required, for example, to have High Availability VIPs in the T0.

![T0 Logical Router in VPC edge services cluster](../../images/vcf-on-vpc-overlay-routing-t0.svg "T0 Logical Router in VPC edge services cluster"){: caption="Figure 1. T0 Logical Router in VPC edge services cluster" caption-side="bottom"}

Currently, Active-Active mode with T0 is not supported in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}.
{: note}

When T0 is run in Active-Standby mode, both participate Edge Transport Node has their own uplink. High availability between these uplinks uses a High Availability VIP.
{: note}

The T0 is configured with **two uplink types**: two uplinks for **private** use and two uplinks for **public** use. HA VIPs are assigned to both public and private uplinks for high availability. For public and private uplinks, two VPC subnets are needed. These subnets are provisioned from the Zone prefix, and they can both use RFC 1918 private addresses, including the public subnet.

Subnet name                   | System traffic type          | Subnet sizing guidance
------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------
vpc-t0-public-uplink-subnet   | T0 public uplink subnet      | `/29` or larger
vpc-t0-private-uplink-subnet  | T0 private uplink subnet     | `/29` or larger
{: caption="Table 1. VPC subnets for NSX-T T0 uplinks" caption-side="bottom"}

If you do not need inbound traffic from the internet, you do not need public uplink subnet.
{: note}

The following VLAN interfaces are required in VPC for each T0 uplink. You must separate the public and private uplinks as specified previously. VLAN interfaces with `Allow IP spoofing` and `Enable Infrastructure NAT` set to `false` allow public floating IP addresses to traverse non-NATted to the public uplinks of the T0 logical router. VLAN interfaces with `Allow IP spoofing` and `Enable Infrastructure NAT` set to `true` allow VMware workloads on NSX-T overlay with private IP addresses to be routed to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}. These functions cannot be combined into one.

Interface name | Interface type | VLAN ID | Subnet | Allow float | Allow IP spoofing | Enable infra NAT | NSX-T interface | Segment name
----------------------------|----------------|---------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------
vlan-nic-t0-pub-uplink-1    | vlan           | 2711    | vpc-t0-public-uplink-subnet  | true         | false             | false             | T0 Public Uplink * Edge 1  | vpc-zone-t0-public-*vlanid*
vlan-nic-t0-pub-uplink-2    | vlan           | 2711    | vpc-t0-public-uplink-subnet  | true         | false             | false             | T0 Public Uplink * Edge 2  | vpc-zone-t0-public-*vlanid*

vlan-nic-t0-priv-uplink-1   | vlan           | 2712    | vpc-t0-private-uplink-subnet | true         | true              | true              | T0 Private Uplink * Edge 1 | vpc-zone-t0-private-*vlanid*
vlan-nic-t0-priv-uplink-2   | vlan           | 2712    | vpc-t0-private-uplink-subnet | true         | true              | true              | T0 Private Uplink * Edge 2 | vpc-zone-t0-private-*vlanid*
vlan-nic-t0-priv-uplink-vip | vlan           | 2712    | vpc-t0-private-uplink-subnet | true         | true              | true              | T0 Private Uplink VIP      | vpc-zone-t0-private-*vlanid*
{: caption="Table 2. VLAN interfaces for T0 uplinks" caption-side="bottom"}

If you do not need inbound traffic from internet, you might not need either public uplinks on T0 or the public VLAN interfaces for the bare metal server.
{: note}

By routing in T0, you need to take the previous note into consideration. If you have public uplinks, your default route `0.0.0.0/0` must be routed through the public uplinks, and any private routes must be routed through private uplinks. Configure your static routes to the gateway of your VPC subnet.
{: note}

You can provision only one pair of uplinks from the T0 Logical Router from the same edge services cluster in the same VPC subnet. This limitation also includes T0 VRFs. Each T0 uplink pair needs its own VPC subnet.
{: note}

## Tier-1 logical router
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers-edge-tier-1}

An NSX-T T1 logical router has downlink connections to the attached NSX-T segments and uplink connections to a single T0 logical router. The NSX Edge Nodes provide the compute capacity for the T1 logical routers. Each T1 logical router contains a service router (SR) and a distributed router (DR), same as with T0s. A DR runs as a kernel module distributed in hypervisors and SR is instantiated as a VRF on an edge services cluster when a service is enabled and cannot be distributed.

In this design, one or more T1 logical routers can be created for the needs of your chosen topologies.

You can deploy multiple T1s in the same edge services cluster.
{: note}

## Network services that are provided by Tier-0 and Tier-1 logical routers
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers-edge-services}

NSX-T Data Center supports network services, such as IPsec Virtual Private Network (IPSec VPN), Network Address Translation (NAT), and Firewalls as shown in the following diagram.

![Network Services that are provided by Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers](../../images/vcf-on-vpc-overlay-services.svg "Network Services that are provided by Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers"){: caption="Figure 2. Network Services provided by Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers" caption-side="bottom"}

The topic gives a brief introduction to these capabilities and how they can be used in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.

### VPN services
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers-edge-services-vpn}

IPsec Virtual Private Network (IPSec VPN) and Layer 2 VPN (L2 VPN) run on an NSX Edge node. IPSec VPN offers site-to-site connectivity between an NSX Edge node and remote sites. With L2 VPN, you can extend your data center by enabling virtual machines (VMs) to keep their network connectivity across geographical boundaries while you use the same IP address.

When you configure NSX-T VPN service in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can use the public `/32` floating IP addresses as the VPN Endpoints both Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers. You can have multiple VPN endpoints, if needed. When VPN service is configured on Tier-1 Logical Router, ensure that the floating IP is correctly advertised between Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers.

For more information about VPN service, see [VMware Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/administration/GUID-A8B113EC-3D53-41A5-919E-78F1A3705F58.html){: external}.

### Network Address Translation
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers-edge-services-nat}

Network Address Translation (NAT) is supported on Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers.

As example, the following types of NAT are supported.

* **Source NAT (SNAT)** translates a source IP address of outbound packets so that packets are shown as originating from a different network.
* **Destination NAT (DNAT)** translates the destination IP address of inbound packets so that packets are delivered to a target address into another network.

You can also disable SNAT or DNAT for an IP address or a range of addresses. If an address has multiple NAT rules, the rule with the highest priority is applied.

When you configure NSX-T NAT in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can use the public `/32` floating IP addresses as the public NAT IP addresses in both Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers. You can have multiple NAT IP addresses, if needed. When NAT is configured on Tier-1 Logical Router, ensure that the floating IP is correctly advertised between Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers.

For more information about NAT in NSX-T, see [VMware Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/administration/GUID-7AD2C384-4303-4D6C-A44A-DEF45AA18A92.html){: external}.

### Firewall
{: #vpc-vcf-nsx-t-logical-routers-edge-services-fw}

You can configure East-West and North-South firewall policies in your NSX-T platform.

Gateway firewall represents rules that are applied to the perimeter firewall for North-South traffic that is connected to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}. Gateway firewall can be applied to both Tier-0 and Tier-1 Logical Routers.

Distributed firewall monitors all the East-West traffic on your VMs. When you group objects, it simplifies the rule management. Groups include different objects that are added both statically and dynamically, and they can be used as the source and destination of a firewall rule. They can be configured to contain a combination of VMs, IP sets, MAC sets, segment ports, segments, AD user groups, and other groups. Dynamic inclusion of groups can be based on tag, machine name, OS name, or computer name.

For more information about Firewalls in NSX-T, see [VMware Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/administration/GUID-F206A4B8-0F33-482D-8727-E71FE253BBCD.html){: external}.
