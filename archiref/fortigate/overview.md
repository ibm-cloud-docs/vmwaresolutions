# Fortinet FortiGate VM overview
{: #fortigate-overview}

{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} offers various solutions to meet your network security requirements. The base offering includes VMware NSX–T™ for integrated virtual networking and security. More network security features are available with the FortiGate® VM offering, which provides Fortinet®’s next–generation firewall (NGFW) capabilities in the form of a highly available pair of virtual FortiGate appliances.

The solution is considered to be an extra component and extension of the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} offering on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. As a result, this document doesn’t cover the existing configuration of the foundation solutions on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information about the foundation solution architecture, see [Overview of VMware Solutions](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-solution_overview).

## Topologies
{: #fortigate-overview-topologies}

You can deploy FortiGate VM according to several different strategies:

* FortiGate VM can be deployed as part of an ESXi™ gateway cluster that is directly integrated with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customer routers. It provides firewall and gateway functions for your private and public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network VLANs.
* FortiGate VM can be deployed to your management and workload cluster. In this form, you can use FortiGate to provide firewall and gateway services between various networks. FortiGate VM provides controlled connectivity between:
   * Public and private networks
   * Private VLANs and NSX logical switches
   * Several VMware NSX® logical switches

Additionally, FortiGate VM offers direct integration with NSX–T including service chaining and dynamic import of security groups.
