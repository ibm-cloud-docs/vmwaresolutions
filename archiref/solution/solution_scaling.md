# Scaling capacity

After initial deployment, you can scale out the compute capacity from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console. The design supports the following scale-out paths:
* Addition of new sites managed by separate vCenter Servers
* Addition of new clusters
* Addition of new hosts to an existing cluster

## Adding more sites

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} can leverage the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} world-wide data center presence and integrated network backbone to allow for various cross-geography use cases to be deployed and functioning within a fraction of the time that it would take to build such an infrastructure from scratch.

In this design, the definition of a multi-site deployment is comprised of the following:
* An initial or primary VMware deployment containing a new DNS/AD root domain, subdomain, SSO domain, and SSO site name to be provided.
* Single or multiple secondary sites that are provisioned into the primary sites SSO domain requiring the following configuration:
   * New SSO site name
   * New DNS site/subdomain tied to the root of the primary domain
   * DNS and AD replication setup between the secondary and primary site AD VMs
   * PSC deployed and configured to synchronize with the primary site PSC
   * vCenter setup with Enhanced Linked Mode to the primary site vCenter

Additionally, the NSX manager in secondary sites may be set up as secondary NSX managers for the NSX manager on the primary site.

## Adding new clusters

You can also scale out the compute capacity by creating a new cluster from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console and ordering new hosts that are automatically added to the new cluster.

This method enables you to achieve the following things:
* Creating an additional, separate cluster in the environment.
* Segregating management workloads from application workloads physically and logically.
* Segregating workloads based on other characteristics, for example, Microsoft SQL database cluster.
* Deploying applications in highly available topologies.

When the initial cluster is converted into a management-only cluster, the migration of existing workloads will involve manual steps to be taken by the user. This might involve the reattachment of data stores to the new cluster or alternately storage migration. The IP addresses of the workloads might need to be changed if the new cluster resides in a different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} pod or is assigned a different VLAN ID.

## Adding ESXi hosts into existing clusters

You can scale out an existing cluster by ordering hosts from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.  The new hosts are automatically added to the cluster. Note that you may need to adjust the HA reservation policy for the cluster based on your reservation requirements.
