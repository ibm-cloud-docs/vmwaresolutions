# VMware Solutions components
{: #design_overview}



{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} provides automation to deploy VMware® technology components into {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} data centers across the globe.

The offerings in this solution include VMware Cloud Foundation™ products within an automatically deployed and configured cluster: VMware vSphere ESXi™, VMware vCenter Server® Appliance, VMware NSX-T™, and optionally, VMware vSAN™.

The architecture consists of a single cloud region. You can extend into more cloud regions that are located in another geography and in another {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} pod within the same data center. A region is defined as a unique {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instance. This design also allows for automated expansion and contraction of virtual capacity within a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instance.
