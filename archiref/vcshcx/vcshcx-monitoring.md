# Monitoring parameters and components

## Using the WAN Optimizer for monitoring
{: #vcshcx-monitoring-using-wan}

The Silver Peak WAN optimization appliance that is deployed as part of HCX does not get its management interface configured. The web user interface (UI) is a
valuable tool to use when you base line traffic throughput and throttling network migration bandwidth use.

Only the HCX CGW Gateway WAN tunnel traffic flows through the WAN Optimizer appliance. Therefore, it cannot monitor stretched L2 traffic.
{:note}

### Configuring the UI
{: #vcshcx-monitoring-config-ui}

Outside of configuring an IP address for the web UI, do not make configuration
changes to the WAN Optimizer appliance unless directed by
{{site.data.keyword.IBM}} or VMware support staff.   

To configure the WAN Opt web UI:
1.	Find the WAN Opt virtual machine (VM) appliance within the vCenter client.
2.	Open up a console to the VM that uses the vCenter client.
3.	Within the console, click **F4** to configure the management interface.
4.	Select to configure a static IP.
5.	Use an IP address on the management {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} assigned portable IP
range and default gateway.
6.	Click **Apply** on the next screen to save.
7.  Click edit settings for the WAN Opt VM within the vCenter console.
8.	Select **Connected at Power On** and **Connected for Network Adapter 1**.
9.	Click **OK** to save.
10.	Find the CGW-<xxx>-WANOPT in vCenter.
11.	Edit settings on the VM.
12.	Click the check box to connect Network adapter 1.
13.	Click **OK**.
14.	Go to `https://<configured_WAN_OPT_IP>`.
15.	Log in with the `admin` default user and the `admin` password.

You can now use the WAN Opt web UI to monitor throughput rates, compression ratios, and to set bandwidth restrictions.

### Migration bandwidth throttling
{: #vcshcx-monitoring-mig-bandwidth}

Before you migrate VMs, perform an assessment of the network link that is used. Work with the networking
engineers for the network that contains the source instance of vSphere or
review weekly and monthly traffic use. Limit available bandwidth for migrations if that traffic
traverses over a link that is critical to your business,
especially if that link is less than 1 Gbps. Use the
side with the most constrained bandwidth, which is typically the
client side.

Do so when you deploy the fleet components in the HCX Client
UI, but post deployment requires you go into the WAN opt UI.

Changes are lost if you redeploy the HCX CGW from the HCX web UI.
This sets bandwidth limits for the migration traffic only. Stretched L2
traffic is not affected by this setting.
{:note}

1. Log in to the WAN Opt Web UI.
2. From the **Configuration** tab, select **Shaper** from the drop-down menu.
3. In the **Max bandwidth** box, set the maximum bandwidth available to the WAN Opt appliance in Kbps. Do not exceed the maximum bandwidth of the WAN link. To set the value in Mbps, multiply by 1,000. To set the value in Gbps, multiply by 1,000,000. The default value is 10 Gbps (10,000,000 Kbps).
4. Click **Apply**.

For stretched L2 bandwidth throttling, QoS can be employed for UDP 500
and 4500 for the tunnel traffic between the L2C appliances.

## Monitoring HCX components
{: #vcshcx-monitoring-hcx-comp}

Monitor HCX components such as HCX Manager, Cloud Gateway, WAN opt, and the Layer 2
Concentrator operations in the following ways:

- Configure HCX Manager to send logs to a syslog server. Use
the HCX manager appliance management utility to run the `https://<hcxhostname or
IP>:9443` command.
- Set up a ping to a VM that is migrated before network swing
for each stretched L2 network.
- Monitor the HCX component VM health with VMware vRealize Operations
Manager or other VMware VM monitoring tools.

## Bandwidth use
{: #vcshcx-monitoring-band-use}

Use the following methods to monitor bandwidth use and latency.

- vMotion Traffic is best accomplished by using the WAN Opt web UI. The WAN Opt dramatically reduces the traffic that is going over the WAN and reduces packet loss by sending redundant packets. It has been observed that the typical ratio LAN to WAN bandwidth usage is approximately 3:1 (350 Mbps LAN = 90-120Mbps WAN).

- Replication-based (bulk) migration of VMs within HCX results in VMs being moved with thick provisioning. While this is not desirable, the WAN opt UI reveals a high ratio between LAN and WAN use when you move unused disk data. Conversely, it is observed that when non-compressible data is migrated, such as DB data and digital media, WAN use is at its highest and it comes closer to LAN use.

Observations:
- The vMotion migration of a VM within HCX does not generate more throughput than the vMotion networking for a single ESXi host.
- As bulk migration can have multiple migrations in flight simultaneously, it achieves higher bandwidth use than a vMotion migration. The ratio observed at a customer side with 1 Gbps vMotion links to the ESX hosts was: Eight replications = bandwidth use of 1 vMotion.
- Moving empty space on disk results in displaying a high LAN use with a
high ratio and subsequently low WAN use. Note that 1 Gbps seems
to be the limit. Indeed, in this particular case the vMotion network is
only capable of 1 Gbps which is the bottleneck.
- vMotion migration of a multi TB Oracle DB. With a WAN link of 1 Gbps,
the limitation is the vMotion network of 1 Gbps.

## Stretched Layer 2 traffic
{: #vcshcx-monitoring-stretched-layer-2-traffic}

The HCX fleet component Layer 2 Concentrator has a bandwidth limitation of approximately 4 Gbps for all L2 network traffic that traverses it. Individually stretched networks have a bandwidth limit of approximately 1 Gbps or less depending on the traffic type. It is possible to have many stretched L2 networks across a single L2C pair (theoretical allowable max of 4096 networks per L2C pair). While the L2C is engineered to detect and protect small traffic flows to not be overcame by large flows within the same L2C pair, it can be advantageous to identify if this situation is occurring and bring up more L2Cs to increase overall bandwidth capability.

Deploying multiple L2Cs can also be advantageous where multiple paths exist between the customer site and {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, such as direct link and internet. A single network cannot be made redundant or given increased bandwidth across multiple L2C pairs.

Monitor the traffic across all interfaces that use the Monitoring tab of the L2C VM. If the total data rate is approaching 8 Gbps (4 Gbps in / out) consider adding another L2 pair and redistribute stretched networks to rebalance.
