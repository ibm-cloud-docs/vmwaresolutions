# Architecture pattern for deploying Tanzu on VMware Cloud Foundation standard architecture
{: #arch-pattern-vcf-tanzu-std}

This architecture pattern explains how to deploy VMware Tanzu on {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc}} standard architecture deployment in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}. Tanzu is a modular, cloud-native application platform that accelerates development, delivery, and operations across multiple clouds. With Tanzu, you can deploy containers on a Kubernetes-based platform that is integrated with VMware vSphere® and VMware NSX®.

An overview of this architecture pattern is shown in the following diagram.

Tanzu can be deployed only on the VMware Cloud Foundation standard architecture.

## Deploying Tanzu on VMware Cloud Foundation standard architecture deployment
{: #arch-pattern-vcf-tanzu-std-deploy}

The following diagram represents high-level deployment steps for Tanzu implementation. In this architecture pattern, Tanzu is deployed into NSX overlay at the VI workload domain.

This architecture pattern deployment is summarized as follows:

1. Design IP addressing for the Tanzu networks on the VI workload domain's NSX overlay. Create VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) routes for routable Tanzu networks with VI workload Tier 0 HA VIP as the next-hop for these networks.
1. Deploy Tanzu on VI workload domain by following the VMware Cloud Foundation and Tanzu documentation.
1. Add DNS records to DNS Service as needed.
