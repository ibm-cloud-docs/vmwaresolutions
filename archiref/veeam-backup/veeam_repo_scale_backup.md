{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

A scale-out backup repository is a repository system with horizontal scaling support for multitier storage of data. A scale-out backup repository has different tiers, or logical levels of storage.
* **Performance tier** - This level is used for fast access to data. It consists of one or more backup repositories or object storage repositories called performance extents.
* **Capacity tier** - Additional level for storing data that needs to be accessed less frequently. However, you can still restore your data directly from it. The capacity tier consists of cloud-based or on-premises object storage repositories called capacity extent.
* **Archive tier** - Additional level for archive storage of infrequently accessed data. Applicable data can be transported ether from the capacity or archive tier. For restorability from the archive tier, data must undergo a preparation process. {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} object storage cannot be used for the Veeam archive tier. Only Amazon S3 Glacier or Microsoft® Azure Archive Storage can be used.

During service deployment, the automation deploys a scale out backup repository, which is created by using either the local repository or the Linux® hardened repository.
