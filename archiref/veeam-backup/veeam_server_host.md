# Virtualization servers and hosts
{: #veeam_server_host}

The virtualization servers and hosts are an infrastructure that must be integrated with VeeamÂ® managed infrastructure. During service deployment, the vCenter Server instance is automatically registered. You can add the following types of servers and hosts to the backup infrastructure:

## General-purpose backup proxies
{: ##veeam_server_host_gen}

A general-purpose backup proxy is a component that operates as a data mover. The backup proxy processes jobs and delivers backup and restore traffic. General-purpose backup proxies can be used for the following operations:
* **NAS backup** - General-purpose backup proxies transfer data between a shared source file and a backup repository. In {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, a general-purpose backup proxy needs to be deployed if you are backing up {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File services in Classic or VPC environments.
* **Veeam agent and integration of storage system snapshot** - General-purpose backup proxies transfer data between a storage system and a backup repository. You cannot integrate any storage system in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. During service deployment, a general-purpose backup proxy is deployed on the Veeam backup server.
