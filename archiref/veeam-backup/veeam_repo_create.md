# Creating a backup repository
{: #veeam_repo_create}

A backup repository is a storage location where Veeam® keeps backup files, VM copies, and metadata for replicated VMs. To configure a backup repository, use the following storage types:

* Direct attached storage. You can add virtual and physical servers as backup repositories:
   * Microsoft Windows® server
   * Linux® server
   * Hardened repository

* Network attached storage. You can add the following network shares as backup repositories:
   * SMB (CIFS) share
   * NFS share
   * Object storage. You can use cloud storage services as backup repositories. For more information, see [Object storage repositories](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam_repo_obj_storage).
