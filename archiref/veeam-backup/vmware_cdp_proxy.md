# VMware CDP proxy
{: #vmware_cdp_proxy}

A VMwareÂ® CDP proxy operates as a data mover and transfers data between the source and target hosts. VMware CDP proxy performs the following tasks:

* Receives virtual machine (VM) data from the production storage.
* Aggregates changed data.
* Prepares data for short-term restore points.
* Compresses and deduplicates data.
* Encrypts and decrypts data.
* Sends data to the storage in the disaster recovery site or another VMware CDP proxy.

You can assign the role of a VMware CDP proxy to any Windows-based or Linux-based virtual or physical server to your Veeam Backup and Replication infrastructure.

In {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} consider using:
* A VM and the HotAdd mode.
* The same VM for both backup and CDP proxy.
