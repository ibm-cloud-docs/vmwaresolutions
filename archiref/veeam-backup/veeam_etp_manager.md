# Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager
{: #veeam_etp_manager}



Veeam® Backup Enterprise Manager is intended for distributed enterprise environments with multiple backup servers. Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager federates backup servers and offers a consolidated view through a web browser interface. You can centrally control and manage all jobs through a single pane of glass. Edit and clone jobs, monitor job state, and get reporting data across all backup servers. 

Furthermore, it also enables searching for virtual machine (VM) guest OS files in all current and archived backups across your backup infrastructure and restores these files in. During service deployment, the automation deploys Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager. To know more about these features, see [Configuring Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/em/em_infrastructure_config.html?ver=120){: external}.
