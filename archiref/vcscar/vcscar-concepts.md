# Skateboarding language concepts

## Skater language

A key aspect of the Skate Advisor is the conversations possible with the Watson driven chatbot. The following section details the conversational rules that define a human interaction with the Skate Advisor Chatbot.

The Skater Language is the core of the system and is used in the following manner:
* Trick recognition: Used by Watson Discovery to ingest material from online sources in order to recognize existing tricks and map to source material.
* Skate conversations: Used by the chatbot to have meaningful conversations with the system user.
* Trick classification: Store and classify a trick based on the textual description of the trick. Tricks that are classified in this way can have metadata attached to them such as location and video references.

## Language elements

### Core elements

The following are the core language elements for constructing a Trick.

Table 1. Core language elements

Element Type | Language text
---|---|---
Direction | fakie<br>nollie<br>switch
Rotation | halfcab<br>cab<br>180<br>360<br>540
Base | kickflip<br>heelflip<br>hardflip<br>bigspin<br>shuvit<br>impossible
landing | manual (back 2 wheels)<br>nosemanual (Front 2 wheels)<br>5-0 (grind)<br>nosegrind<br>tailslide<br>noseslide<br>crooked grind<br>smithgrind<br>boardslide<br>lipslide<br>

### Element modifiers

Element modifiers are special language elements that give context to certain aspects of the language.

Table 2. Language modifiers

Element Type | Language Text |Notices
---|---|---
Turn Prefix | Frontside<br>backside | The Turn Prefix relates to the direction of a turn
Varial | Inward<br>outward |

## Language rules

The following ruleset constructs the language. Tricks are divided into one or more combinations of elements that are referred to as a “Combo”. There's a difference between the first Combo and the following Combos in the sense that the direction is assumed to be the same as in the base Combo unless otherwise specified.

For the following rules, see the Core Elements and Element Modifiers as a reference as they're used to construct the language.

### Trick ruleset

*   **base_combo** = 'direction \+ \[varial | turn_prefix\] \+
\[rotation\] \+ \[base_trick\]'
*   **next_combo** = ''\[varial | turn_prefix\] \+ \[rotation\] \+
\[base_trick\]'
*   **landing_combo** = ''\[varial | turn_prefix\] \+ landing'
*   **trick** = 'combo \+ \[“to” + combo\] \+ \[“to” \+ landing_combo\]'

### Trick rule engine

The following diagram is a visual summary of the rule engine.

nollie-kickflip to crooked grind

nollie-kickflip to crooked grind to nollie-halfcab-kickflip (out)

frontside-nollie-halfcab-heelflip to fakie-nosegrind

backside-nollie-halfcab-kickflip to backside-tailslide to backside-180-out

frontside-nollie-cab-kicflip halfcab to backside-smithgrind

halfcab to backside-smithgrind to backside-180-bigspin (out)

kickflip-backside-tailslide to backside-180-kickflip

kickflip-backside-tailslide to backside-backside-bigspin

360-kicflip to nosemanual to nollie-360-kickflip

360-kicflip to frontside-lipslide

harflip to backside-lipslide

kicflip to frontside-boardslidev

nollie-heelflip to frontside-boardslide

```

## Relevance

The Trick Language is the key construct that is used to train Watson to recognize and ingest skating documents and media and also forms the basis of conversations with the user.
