# Configuration tasks
{: #opsprocs-configure}

After you provision your VMware vCenter Server® instance, system administrators might need to run the following configuration tasks. These tasks set the initial environment to the enterprise needs and to respond to future service requests.

## Instance and cluster guidance
{: #opsprocs-configure-instance}

| Title | Description |
|---|---|
| Naming convention | One of the first tasks is to adopt a naming convention for your vCenter Server instance. You can extend your existing naming convention that is used by your organization or create one. For more information, see [Naming convention in VMware validated design 4.1](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/4.1/com.vmware.vvd.sddc-upgrade.doc/GUID-FCA126F1-E429-454E-B3BA-226525742DC1.html){: external}. Before you adopt a naming convention and change names in your vCenter Server instance, see [Considerations about changing vCenter Server artifacts](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcenter_chg_impact#vcenter_chg_impact).|
| Connecting to your vCenter Server instance | After provisioning, connect to vCenter Server. You can deploy a jump server so that you can connect to the jump server by using the internet. Then, connect from the jump server to vCenter Server by using the private network. Or, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPN, which is a VPN connection from your location to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network, which allows out-of-band management and vCenter access. For more information, see [Getting started with IBM Cloud SSL Virtual Private Networking](/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-getting-started). |
| Configure name resolution | To use the features in vCenter, add name resolution for the vCenter Server components to your workstation or jump server. The `/etc/hosts` or `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` file requires entries for the Platform Services Controller (PSC), vCenter Server and the vSphere ESXi™ hosts. For more information, see [Deploying an OVF file by using the VMware vSphere Web Client](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_deploy_ovf#trbl_deploy_ovf). |
| RBAC | For more information about required privileges for common tasks in the vSphere environment, see [Required privileges for common tasks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-4D0F8E63-2961-4B71-B365-BBFA24673FDB.html){: external}. |
| Using custom Certificate Authority Signed Certificate | See [Replace machine SSL certificates with custom certificates](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.authentication.doc/GUID-BF92822E-8005-4954-8BB5-09479A7B2165.html){: external}. |
| Configure vSphere monitoring  | vSphere includes a user-configurable events and alarms subsystem, which tracks events from vSphere components and stores the data in log files and the vCenter Server database. Events (Information, Warning, and Error) are records of user or system actions that occur on vSphere objects. Alarms are notifications that are activated in response to state of an vSphere object. Alarms have the following severity levels: Normal – green, Warning – yellow, and Alert – red. Alarm actions are operations that occur in response to an alarm, for example, an email notification is sent. For more information about how you can configure and use the vSphere monitoring, see [Monitoring events, alarms, and automated actions](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-9272E3B2-6A7F-427B-994C-B15FF8CADC25.html){: external}. |
| Adding clusters | Your vCenter Server instance was deployed with a cluster of vSphere ESXi hosts. You can add more clusters to your instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. For more information, see [Adding clusters to vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingclusters). |
| vCenter Server capacity | You can expand or contract the capacity of your VMware vCenter Server instance according to your business needs, by adding or removing vSphere ESXi servers or Network File System (NFS) storage. For more information, see [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservers). |
| vCenter Server instance services | After your vCenter Server instance is deployed you can add addition services, such as a disaster recovery, severity, or backup solution. When you no longer need these services, you can remove them from your instances. For more information, see [Ordering services for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservices). |
| vCenter Server instance updates | The process of applying fixes and updates to vCenter Server instances is automated for the management components only. |
| Multisite configuration | The multisite configuration feature uses a hub and spoke topology with one primary site and a maximum of 14 secondary sites. For more information, see [Multisite configuration for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_multisite#vc_multisite) and [Deleting vCenter Server instances in a multisite configuration](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletinginstance_multi#vc_deletinginstance_multi). |
| Using VMware Update Manager | After deployment, the VMware products are updated by your system administrators. For more information about how your system administrators can use VUM in a vCenter Server Instance, see [VMware Update Manager introduction](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vum-intro#vum-intro). |
| Key vCenter Server Instance components backup | Your system administrators are responsible for the configuration, management, and monitoring of all software components of vCenter Server instance, including the backup and availability of the management infrastructure and workloads. As part of the solution, you can optionally deploy the Veeam add-on service that can help with backing up your management components. For more information, see [Backing up components](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-solution_backingup). |
| Collecting diagnostic information for VMware products | VMware Technical Support routinely requests diagnostic information when a support request is handled. This diagnostic information contains product-specific logs, configuration files, and data appropriate to the situation. For more information about URLs to VMware Knowledgebase articles and detailed step-by-step tasks for collecting this information, see [Collecting diagnostic information for VMware products](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1008524?CoveoV2.CoveoLightningApex.getInitializationData=1&r=2&ui-communities-components-aura-components-forceCommunity-seoAssistant.SeoAssistant.getSeoData=1&other.KM_Utility.getArticleDetails=1&other.KM_Utility.getArticleMetadata=2&other.KM_Utility.getUrl=1&other.KM_Utility.getUser=1&other.KM_Utility.getAllTranslatedLanguages=2&ui-comm-runtime-components-aura-components-siteforce-qb.Quarterback.validateRoute=1){: external}.

| Enable encryption | For more information about using the KMIP for VMware service to enable encryption, see [KMIP for VMware overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-kmip_standalone_considerations#kmip_standalone_considerations). For more information about enabling VM encryption, see [Virtual machine encryption](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-E6C5CE29-CD1D-4555-859C-A0492E7CB45D.html){: external}. For more information about using data at rest encryption to protect data in your vSAN cluster, see [Using encryption on a vSAN cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.virtualsan.doc/GUID-F3B2714F-3406-48E7-AC2D-3677355C94D3.html){: external}.|
| Add vSAN storage | For more information about adding more vSphere ESXi hosts to your existing vSAN cluster, see [Adding ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservers). The addition of more hosts increases CPU, RAM, and storage to your cluster. For more information about vSAN technology, see [Expanding a vSAN cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.virtualsan.doc/GUID-666D9839-2726-4936-8C0F-94476ECE0606.html){: external}. |
| Remove vSAN storage | For more information about removing storage from a vSAN cluster, see [Removing ESXi servers from vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_removingservers). The removal of hosts decreases CPU, RAM, and storage in your cluster. |
| Using default vSAN alarms | The default vSAN alarms can be used to monitor the cluster, hosts, and existing vSAN licenses. These alarms are automatically triggered when the events corresponding to the alarms are activated or if one or all the conditions that are specified in the alarms are met. You cannot edit the conditions or delete the default alarms. To configure alarms that are specific to your requirements, create custom alarms for vSAN. For more information about monitoring alarms, events, editing existing alarm settings, and using the default vSAN alarms to monitor your cluster, hosts, analyze any new events, and assess the overall cluster health, see [Using the vSAN default alarms](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan-monitoring.doc/GUID-E7885CDE-654D-4732-A5FE-31D0AB2B2F57.html){: external}. |
| Enable SIOC | By default, Storage IO Control (SIOC) is disabled. If you are experiencing poor performance for VMs in a datastore, you can enable SIOC to help with prioritization to storage resources. SIOC is only activated when there is storage contention to ensure that every VM gets its share of storage resources. Using a VM storage policy and assigning that policy to a VM or VMDK enables this. For more information, see [Managing storage I/O resources](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-7686FEC3-1FAC-4DA7-B698-B808C44E5E96.html){: external}. |
| Configure a datastore cluster | A datastore cluster is a collection of datastores with shared resources and a shared management interface. Datastore clusters are to datastores what clusters are to hosts. When you create a datastore cluster, you can use vSphere Storage DRS to manage storage resources. When you add a datastore to a datastore cluster, the datastore's resources become part of the datastore cluster's resources. Use datastore clusters to aggregate storage resources, providing support resource allocation policies at the datastore cluster level. For more information, see [Creating a datastore cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-598DF695-107E-406B-9C95-0AF961FC227A.html){: external}. |

## Network procedures
{: #opsprocs-configure-networks}

| Title | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| Network considerations | For more information, see [Networking considerations for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_networkingonvcenterserver). |
| Planning for HCX | VMware Hybrid Cloud Services (HCX), allows disparate instances of vSphere software defined data centers (SDDC) to interoperate across various network types. HCX is designed to address the security, compatibility, complexity, and performance concerns one would encounter in trying to achieve a multi-instance, multisite, deployment of vSphere extending across on-premises and cloud provider boundaries. For more information, see [Preparing the installation environment](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-hcxclient-planning-prep-install). |
| Initial NSX configuration | As part of the deployment of your vCenter Server instance, a sample customer network is available that consists of a private subnet, a public subnet, an NSX logical switch, a distributed logical router, and an NSX edge appliance that is deployed and configured to perform network address translation. For steps to configure this sample customer network for your VMs, see [Configuring your network to use the customer-managed NSX ESG with your VMs](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_esg_config#vc_esg_config). |
| Add a logical switch | Logical switches are similar to VLANs, in that they provide network connections to which you can attach your VMs. The VMs can then communicate with each other over VXLAN if the VMs are connected to the same logical switch. When you are adding logical switches, it is important to have in mind a particular topology that you are building. For more information, see [Add a logical switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.install.doc/GUID-DD31D6BC-2E56-4E91-B45F-FCA3E80FF786.html){: external}. |
| Add a DLR | A Distributed Logical Router (DLR) is a virtual appliance that routes between connected logical switches (East-West traffic). For more information, see [Add a Distributed Logical Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.install.doc/GUID-E825C0C7-F4CC-4B26-90AF-A2167AC519DB.html){: external}. |
| Add an ESG | An External Services Gateway (ESG) is a virtual appliance that routes between the physical network and the logical network (North-South traffic). For more information, see [Add an Edge Services Gateway](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.install.doc/GUID-B9A97F20-4996-4E16-822C-0B98DDE70571.html){: external}. |
| Configure NSX edge firewall rules | An edge firewall monitors North-South traffic to provide perimeter security functions, including firewall, Network Address Translation (NAT), and site-to-site IPsec and SSL VPN. Only the firewall rules on management and uplink interfaces are applicable. For more information, see [Working with NSX Edge firewall rules](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.admin.doc/GUID-178B11B8-FEB1-49B8-B6FF-D069C41EEB32.html){: external}. |
| Distributed firewall | The distributed firewall is a hypervisor kernel-embedded firewall that provides network access control for VMs. You create access control policies based on VMware vCenter objects like: data centers, cluster, VM names, IP, VLAN (DVS port-groups), VXLAN (logical switches), security groups, and user group identity from Active Directory. Firewall rules are enforced at the vNIC level of each VM to provide consistent access control even when the VM gets vMotioned. For more information, see [Distributed firewall](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.admin.doc/GUID-95600C1C-FE9A-4652-821B-5BCFE2FD8AFB.html){: external}. |
| Configure NAT rules  | NSX Edge provides Network Address Translation (NAT) services to assign a different source or destination IP address to a VM or a group of VMs. The NAT service configuration is separated into Source NAT (SNAT) and Destination NAT (DNAT) rules. For more information, see [Managing NAT rules](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.admin.doc/GUID-5896D8CF-20E0-4691-A9EB-83AFD9D36AFD.html){: external}. |
| Configure NSX load balancer | The NSX Edge load balancer enables high-availability service and distributes the network traffic load among multiple VMs. It distributes incoming service requests evenly among multiple VMs in such a way that the load distribution is transparent to users. Load balancing helps in achieving optimal resource usage, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload. NSX Edge provides load balancing up to Layer 7. You map an external, or public, IP address to a set of internal VMs for load balancing. The load balancer accepts TCP, UDP, HTTP, or HTTPS requests on the external IP address and decides which internal server to use. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP and port 443 is the default port for HTTPs. Two types of load-balancing services are available in NSX: one-armed mode (proxy mode) or Inline mode (transparent mode). For more information, see [Logical Load Balancer](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.admin.doc/GUID-152982CF-108F-47A6-B86A-0F0F6A56D628.html){: external}. |

| Deploy a Cisco Firepower appliance  | The [FortiGate Virtual Appliance service](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-fortinetvm_considerations#fortinetvm_considerations) deploys a pair of FortiGate Virtual Appliances to your environment, which can help you reduce risk by implementing critical security controls within your virtual infrastructure. However, you can implement your own third-party solution as needed. For more information about adding a Cisco Firepower appliance to your vCenter Server instance, see [Deploy the firepower threat defense virtual using the VMware vSphere Web Client or vSphere hypervisor](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/quick_start/vmware/ftdv/ftdv-vmware-qsg.html#17970){: external}. |
| Direct Link | After the deployment of your vCenter Server instance, your system administrators can connect to your instance through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} management VPN. Your system administrators can then configure internet access for your workloads. However, you might want to use a direct connection and not the internet. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link is a suite of four offerings from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Network, with availability in locations around the globe. Each one enables customers to create direct, private connections between their remote network environments and their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployments, without using the public internet. Most commonly, these offerings are implemented to support hybrid workloads, cross-provider workloads, large or frequent data transfers, private workloads, or to ease administration of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment. For more information, see [Get started with IBM Cloud Direct Link](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link#get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link). For more information about a vCenter Server instance that is only accessible by using a private network, see [Public or private network](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_orderinginstance-consoldworkldcluster-settings#vc_orderinginstance-public-private-network). |
| Deploy a web proxy | When the VMware Server instance is deployed, the VCSA does not have direct access to the VMware repositories to enable updates of vSAN health checks. For information about deploying a squid web proxy VM to enable access to these repositories [Initial configuration](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vum-init-config#vum-init-config-install-cfg-squid). This procedure is also relevant for other proxy applications from different vendors. |
| Firewall Logging | The NSX edge and distributed firewalls generate and stores log files, such as audit logs, rules message logs, and system event logs. You must configure a syslog server for each cluster that has enabled the firewall. For more information, see [Firewall logs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.admin.doc/GUID-6F9DC53E-222D-464B-8613-AB2D517CE5E3.html){: external}. The operations management in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} includes vRealize Log Insight, which acts as a syslog server. |
| NSX logging and system events | For more information about configuring a syslog server for the NSX components and for information about system events, alarms, audit logs, and collecting technical support logs, see [NSX logging and system events](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.logging.doc/GUID-3F08DC2E-2D82-4C89-8829-EF1EA0160B13.html){: external}. |
| Deploying HCX on-premises | For more information, see [Considerations for on-premises VMware HCX instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-standalone_considerations#standalone_considerations){: external}. |
| HCX Check | The HCX service seamlessly extends the networks of on-premises data centers into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} so you can migrate VMs to and from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} without any conversion or change. For more information about accessing the HCX Cloud Management console and applying updates to HCX, see [Managing VMware HCX](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-managinghcx). |
| vSphere Distributed Switch MTU supported status and vSphere Distributed Switch VLAN trunked status | Depending on the options that you selected when you placed your order, your clusters might be deployed on different VLANs. In this case, warnings might be generated by the VMware Distributed Switch (vDS) Health Check because some port groups in the vDS are not applicable to all clusters that belong to that vDS. These warnings can be ignored because the VMs attached to those port groups are located in the appropriate cluster. However, if you want to disable the vDS Health Check, complete the following two procedures.  \n   \n To disable the vDS health check, complete the following tasks:  \n 1. On the vSphere Client home page, click Networking and go to the distributed switch.  \n 2. Click the Configure tab and expand Settings.  \n 3. Select Health Check and click Edit.  \n 4. Use the menus to disable health check options.  \n   \n To disable the alarms, complete the following tasks:  \n 1. On the vSphere Client home page, in the inventory window, click the top-level object and go to Configure, Alarm Definitions.  \n 2. Using the filter in the **Alarm Name** column, filter on **Switch**.  \n 3. Select Sphere Distributed Switch MTU supported status and select Disable.  \n 4. Select vSphere Distributed Switch VLAN trunked status and select Disable. |
