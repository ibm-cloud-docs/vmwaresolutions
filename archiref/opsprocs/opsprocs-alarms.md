# Alarms
{: #opsprocs-alarms}

## Introduction
{: #opsprocs-alarms-intro}

VMware vSphere® includes an events and alarms subsystem, which tracks events that occur in the vSphere environment and makes this information available in vCenter. The following terminology is used in this subsystem.

### Events
{: #opsprocs-alarms-events}

Events are records of system or user actions that occur on objects in vCenter such as hosts and virtual machines (VMs). Event data includes details about the event such as who generated it, when it occurred, and what type of event it is. In the vSphere Web Client, event data is displayed in the Monitor tab.

The following are event classifications.
* Error - Indicates that an unrecoverable problem occurred in the system and ends the process or operation.
* Warning - Indicates a potential risk to the system, which needs to be fixed. This event does not end the process or operation.
* Information - Describes that the user or system operation is completed successfully.
* Audit - The audit log data includes information about what is the action, who did it, when it occurred, and the IP address of the user.

### Alarms
{: #opsprocs-alarms-alarms}

Alarms are notifications that are activated in response to an event, a set of conditions, or the state of an inventory object.

An alarm definition consists of the following elements in the vSphere Client.
* Name and description - Provides an identifying label and description.
* Targets - Defines the type of object that is monitored.
* Alarm Rules - Defines the event, condition, or state that triggers the alarm and defines the notification severity. It also defines operations that occur in response to triggered alarms.
* Last modified - The last modified date and time of the defined alarm.

Alarms have the following severity levels.
* Normal – green.
* Warning – yellow.
* Alert – red.

### Alarm definition
{: #opsprocs-alarms-def}

Alarm definitions are associated with the object that is selected in the inventory and monitors the type of inventory objects that are specified in its definition.

An alarm definition consists of the following elements.
* Name and description - Provides an identifying label and description.
* Alarm type - Defines the type of object that is monitored.
* Triggers - Defines the event, condition, or state that triggers the alarm and defines the notification severity.
* Tolerance thresholds (Reporting) - Provides more restrictions on condition and state triggers thresholds that must be exceeded before the alarm is triggered.
* Actions - Defines operations that occur in response to triggered alarms. VMware provides sets of predefined actions that are specific to inventory object types.
* Alarm Actions - Alarm actions are operations that occur in response to the trigger. For example, you can send an email notification to one or more administrators when an alarm is triggered.
* Acknowledge triggered alarms - After you acknowledge an alarm, the alarm actions are discontinued. Alarms are not cleared, or reset when acknowledged. Acknowledging an alarm signals to other users know that you are taking ownership of the issue.
* Reset triggered alarms - An alarm that is triggered by an event might not reset to a normal state if vCenter does not retrieve the event that identifies the normal condition. In such cases, reset the alarm manually.
* Preconfigured vSphere alarms - The vSphere event and alarm subsystem has a number of default alarms, which monitor the operations of vSphere inventory objects. You must set up actions only for these alarms.

## Alarm setup workflow
{: #opsprocs-alarms-setup-workflow}

VMware provides preconfigured vCenter alarms that are described in the following tables, but they are set with an action to display within the vCenter web client only. Configure the SMTP server details and then set the alert actions to send an email to the system administrators for the following alarms only initially so not to inundate the system administrator team. For more information, see [Send email as an alarm action](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-1F940DAF-933B-44B7-A200-7A11B5D3E3D5.html){: external}.

The setting alarms workflow is as follows.
* Configure the SMTP server details.
* Configure the alert actions for clusters, hosts, datastores, and critical virtual appliances, such as vCenter Server Appliance, PSC, NSX Manager, and controllers.
   * Cluster - a VMware High Availability error.
   * Hosts - CPU status, memory status, storage status, hardware status that is, voltage, temperature, or power status changes.
   * Datastore  - low on free disk space.
   * Critical virtual appliance -  CPU usage, memory usage, disk latency
* Use the proactive daily task to review the following information.
   * Review the alerts sent - are the alerts required?
   * Review the alerts that weren't sent - do you need to know about them?
   * Review the metrics - are the metrics correct? For example, confirm that CPU usage must be set to 75% rather than 90% now that you understand your baseline.
   * Do you need to configure your own alarms?
   * Do you need to include virtual machines?

##  Typical alarm workflow
{: #opsprocs-alarms-alarm-workflow}

After set-up, review the following example of an alarm workflow, typically adopted by system administrators, when an alarm is triggered.

1. A host has an alarm set to monitor CPU usage and the alarm has an alarm action to send an email to the administrators when the alarm is triggered, as described in the previous section.
2. The host CPU usage spikes, triggering the alarm, which sends an email to the administrators.
3. One of the administrators logs in to vCenter and acknowledges the triggered alarm to allow the other administrators know the problem is being addressed, and to prevent the alarm from sending more email messages. However, the alarm is still visible in the system.
4. The administrator finds the cause of the CPU spike and rectifies.
5. The alarm is reset automatically.

## Preconfigured alarms - standard
{: #opsprocs-alarms-preconfigured-std}

* Alarm Name - The name of the alarm visible in vCenter.
* Guidance - {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} guidance on the use of this alarm.
* More Information - Additional information available from IBM or VMware to help with the resolution of these alarms when they are triggered.

The following table describes the standard preconfigured alarms.
