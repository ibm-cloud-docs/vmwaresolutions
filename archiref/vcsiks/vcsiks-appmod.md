# Application modernization overview
{: #vcsiks-appmod}

The following diagram shows the application modernization reference architecture that Acme Skateboards deploy and is described in depth in this series of documents.

![Architecture overview diagram](../../images/vcsiks-aod.svg "Architecture overview diagram"){: caption="Figure 1. Architecture overview diagram" caption-side="bottom"}

This hybrid architecture allows Acme Skateboards to:
- Migrate VMware virtual machines (VMs) from on-premises to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} with little or no downtime and no application reconfiguration.
- Enable them to start the application modernization journey by allowing them to focus on containerizing the simpler web interfaces and middleware while allowing more complex databases to remain as VMs.
- Use Cloud Automation Manager (CAM) to script infrastructure as code (IaC) to compose and orchestrate services that are made from both VMs and containers to integrate with their DevOps toolchains and their ITSM solution.

The reference architecture has the following key components:
- **On-premises virtualization** – On-premises virtualization is a VMware cluster that currently hosts the Acme Skateboards VMs. These VMs are currently hosting the applications to be modernized. This cluster is required to meet the prerequisites of the [VMware HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} solution architecture](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmware-solutions-hcx-archi-intro#hcx-archi-intro) architecture so that it can run HCX.

HCX extends the on-premises networks into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} allowing customers to migrate VMs into the VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance that runs on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, and back if required.
- **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware Solutions** – The vCenter Server instance provides the fundamental VMware building blocks, such as vSphere, vCenter Server, NSX-V, and storage options that include vSAN or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Endurance storage, needed to automatically deploy a VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) solution. The VMware cluster is the target for the migrated VMs and some of the modernized applications in containers hosted in {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}}. The key components in vCenter Server are as follows:
  - **NSX-V** - NSX-V provides the network virtualization layer in vCenter Server that provides a network overlay for Acme Skateboards VMs. NSX-V enables BYOIP and isolates the workload networks from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} networks. NSX-V is programmed by HCX to create the networks that Acme Skateboards extend from on-premises.
  - **NSX-T** - NSX-T provides a common set of tools for network and security management across both containers and VMs. NSX-T is fully compatible with Kubernetes Container Networking Interface (CNI) and integrates with CNI to provide container networking. NSX-T provides the overlay network that the modernized applications use and is replacing Calico, which is used natively by {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.

- **{{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}}** - {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} is an application platform for developing and managing containerized applications. {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} is an integrated environment that includes the container orchestrator Kubernetes, a private image repository, a management console, monitoring frameworks and a graphical user interface that provides a centralized location from where Acme Skateboards can deploy, manage, monitor, and scale their applications. The vCenter Server instance hosts the {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} components, master nodes, worker nodes, and so on, running them as VMs. {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} hosts the following components:
  - **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Automation Manager** – CAM is an enterprise-ready infrastructure as code (IaC) platform that provides a single pane of glass to provision VM workloads, on-premises or on vCenter Server, alongside Kubernetes workloads, in {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, by using templates. CAM is a Dockerized application that runs on an {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} installation and is tightly integrated for authorization, role-based access control (RBAC), and other functions.
  - The containerized **Acme Skateboards applications** that customers want to deploy in this environment.

- **{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}** – {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} enables Acme Skateboards to deploy their modernized applications in Docker containers that run in Kubernetes clusters. The master modes are fully managed by IBM while the worker nodes in the worker pool are deployed into the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account as their vCenter Server instance. Worker nodes can be: bare metal, public, or dedicated virtual server instances. Calico is installed and configured automatically in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. Calico provides secure network connectivity for containers and is configured in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} to use IP-in-IP encapsulation for packets that travel across subnets and to use NAT for outgoing connections from the containers.

- **Direct Link** – {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link uses Acme Skateboard’s WAN provider to connect their data center to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to provide a reliable, low latency, secure network connection. This connection provides:
  - Access to the cloud hosted applications from your Enterprise users.
  - Inter VM traffic between on-premises VMs and cloud VMs.
  - Traffic between legacy systems in the on-premises data center and cloud VMs.

## Key benefits to Acme Skateboards
{: #vcsiks-appmod-benefits}

vCenter Server provides the fundamental building blocks that include VMware vSphere, vCenter Server, NSX, and shared storage options that include vSAN, which is needed to design a VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) flexible solution that best fits your workloads.

In summary, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware offerings:
* Accelerate delivery of IT projects to Developers and lines of business by reducing the time that it takes for procurement, architecture, implementation, and deployment of resources from weeks or months, to hours.
* Enhance security with dedicated bare metal servers in a hosted private cloud, including private network service endpoint deployment to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, including {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} and KMIP.
* Enable consistent management and governance of the deployed hybrid cloud by providing full administrative access to virtualization management. The management preserves your existing VMware tools, scripts, and investments in training.
* Use VMware expertise at global scale with IBM Professional and Managed Services spanning 30+ {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} worldwide.

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is a managed Kubernetes offering to deliver powerful management tools, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to enable rapid delivery of applications all while using Cloud Services including cognitive capabilities from Watson. IBM is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Platinum member and our offering complies with the CNCF Kubernetes conformance testing program.

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides native Kubernetes capabilities such as:
- Intelligent scheduling maximizes use of the underlying cluster resources by deploying apps in a way that ensure CPU-intensive and RAM-intensive pods are colocated.
- Self-healing for containerized applications and microservices ensuring those components are redeployed automatically if something goes awry.
- Horizontal scaling to allow you to configure a deployment policy, which the orchestrator uses to ensure that the workloads have the required capacity.
- Service discovery and load balancing provide a lightweight DNS within the Kubernetes cluster that allows services to register themselves and eliminate the need for static coding of your microservices. Load balancing distributes incoming requests to the number of instances that run in your architecture.
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks support teams who deploy new features and fixes in a controlled manner. If something breaks, we can automatically roll back to the previously known good version of the image.
- Secret and configuration management. Secrets are an object within Kubernetes that stores sensitive data such as a password, token, or a key. These secrets are encrypted by default and ensure that access to this sensitive data is controlled.

Customers moving toward cloud native application platforms such as {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} are focused on speed and innovation and don’t always have security and networking in mind. Application time to value decreases if they need to wait until networking or security teams can order services like load balancers, firewalls, switches, and routers.

This reference architecture shows how VCS, {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}}, and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} move Acme Skateboards securely along the application modernization journey.
