# Overview of roll-your-own VMware solution on VPC
{: #vpc-ryo-overview}

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} offerings help you extend your existing VMware® virtualized data center into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} provides you compute capacity to host VMware workloads in the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.

With this solution, you have the flexibility to design a VMware deployment for your needs, which is integrated with {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}. The following diagram shows an overview of the solution.

![Overview of VMware on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](../../images/vpc-ryo-diagrams-overview.svg "The solution virtualizes compute, network, and optionally storage resources to be used by VMs where you can run your applications."){: caption="Figure 1. Overview of VMware on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}" caption-side="bottom"}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server is integrated with the VPC network, and you can take advantage of the network, storage, and security capabilities provided by {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}. Use VMware vSAN™ for storage and VMware NSX-T™ for network capabilities. You can easily and quickly add and remove ESXi hosts. Also, add, configure, and remove VMware vSphere® clusters as you like. If your storage needs grow, you can add and attach {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} file shares.

After the bare metal server provisioning and initial VMware configurations, you can access and manage the IBM-hosted environment. To do this step, you can use VMware clients, command line interface (CLI), existing scripts, or other familiar vSphere API-compatible tools. These options can be combined with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation solutions, such as using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Terraform provider with Schematics.

For the required common services, such as NTP and DNS, you can use {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} basic services and solutions. For Active Directory™, you can use {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} compute resources to build your Active Directory in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, or interconnect with your existing Active Directory infrastructure.

For connectivity needs, you can use {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} interconnectivity solutions. For public internet network access capabilities, the options include floating IP addresses and Public Gateway configurations within your VPC.

On-premises connectivity over public internet can be arranged by using {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} VPN services (site-to-site and client-to-site), or alternatively NSX-T built-in capabilities. For private networking, you can use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} interconnectivity services to connect your VMware workloads with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure, other VPCs, and on-premises networks.

## Key responsibilities
{: #vpc-ryo-overview-responsibilities}

With the roll-your-own VMware Solutions in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you are responsible for ordering the VPC, prefixes, and subnets for it. Also, ordering the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server and setting up the vSphere clusters, including installing and configuring VMware vCenter Server®, vSAN, NSX-T, attaching file storage.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} has the VMware ESXi™ 7.x hypervisor preinstalled. IBM can manage the licensing, or you can bring your own license to the solution.

For day two of operation, it is your responsibility to monitor and manage the vCenter and NSX-T, including backups, patching, configuration, and monitoring of the VMware software and the underlying vSphere hypervisor.

## Key benefits
{: #vpc-ryo-overview-benefits}

The architecture provides fundamental building blocks, which include VMware vSphere, vCenter Server, VMware NSX-T, and shared storage options, such as VMware vSAN or {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} file share. These building blocks are needed to flexibly design a VMware software-defined data center solution that best fits your workloads.

VMware Solutions in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} have the following key benefits over {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic deployments:

* {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} gives you the ability to easily and rapidly define and control a virtual network, which is logically isolated from all other tenants. The logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security that is built into the platform.
* Provisioning the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} takes minutes instead of hours when compared to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic.
* VMware workloads by running in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} can take advantage of all original functions for VPC networking capabilities and other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} interconnectivity services.

With this single-tenant {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server infrastructure that is provided in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can quickly deploy network, compute, and storage capacity for your VMware environment to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} in minutes.

Unlike the managed service offerings, this architecture gives you flexibility to design a solution for your needs, and provides you full and complete access to all components.
