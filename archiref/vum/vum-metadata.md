#	Collecting the metadata

VUM downloads metadata about the upgrades, patches, or extensions via a predefined automatic process that you can modify. At regular configurable intervals, VUM contacts VMware, or third-party sources, to gather the latest metadata about available upgrades, patches, or extensions. However, the default settings from VMware are acceptable for use in the VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} instance you can change them as needed for your enterprise requirements.

VUM displays system-managed baselines that are generated by vSAN. The system-managed baselines automatically update their content periodically, which requires VUM to have constant access to the internet. The vSAN system baselines are typically refreshed every 24 hours.

You can use the system-managed baselines to upgrade your vSAN clusters to recommended critical patches, drivers, updates, or latest supported ESXi host version for vSAN.

For most enterprises, the VMware default settings for VUM are considered to be suitable. The following information provides how to change these settings if your enterprise would like to use different settings.
