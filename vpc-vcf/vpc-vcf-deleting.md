# Deleting VMware Cloud Foundation instances
{: #vpc-vcf-deleting}

When you delete a VMware Cloud Foundationâ„¢ instance, the following components are released:
1. VMware Cloud Foundation licenses
2. VMware Cloud Foundation products
3. All {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} ({{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}) assets
4. All {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that were deployed

   You can review the next account invoice to confirm that you are no longer being billed for this instance. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage > Billing and usage**, then click **Invoices**.
   {: tip}

## Before you delete VMware Cloud Foundation instances
{: #vpc-vcf-deleting-before}

Only the resources that were created from the VMware Solutions console can be deleted. If you added ESXi servers to the VMware Cloud Foundation instance manually, the resources for those servers must be deleted manually as well.

## Procedure to delete VMware Cloud Foundation instances from the Resources page
{: #vpc-vcf-deleting-proc1}

1. In the VMware Solutions console, click **Resources > Cloud Foundation** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **VMware Cloud Foundation** table, find the instance to delete.
3. Click the recycle bin icon next to the **Status** column.

   The instance status is changed to **Deleting**. When the instance is deleted successfully, all {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} resources and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instances that are associated with this instance are deleted, and the instance is removed from the table.

   If you receive a deletion error after you clicked **Delete instance**, click **Delete instance** again.
