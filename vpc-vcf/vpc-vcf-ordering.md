## Deployment
{: #vpc-vcf-ordering-deployment}

Review the deployment settings.

### Instance name
{: #vpc-vcf-ordering-instance-name}

The instance name is preset to **myvcf**. The instance name is also used as the Schematics workspace name, which is created during deployment.

You can also specify an instance name that meets the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric, hyphen (-), and underscore (_) characters are allowed.
* The maximum length of the instance name is 64 characters.

### Resource name prefix
{: #vpc-vcf-ordering-resource-prefix}

The prefix for all names of the resources to be created in the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} infrastructure that your {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instance is based on. By default, the prefix **vcf** is added.

You can also specify a resource name prefix that meets the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and hyphen (-) characters are allowed.
* The maximum length of the resource name prefix is 10 characters.
* Must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character.

### Resource group
{: #vpc-vcf-ordering-resource-group}

Use resource groups to organize the resources in your account for access control and billing purposes. By default, **Create new** is selected and a **vcf-_xxx_-rg** resource group is created in your account. Ensure that you have permission to create a new resource group in the current account.

You can also select other resource groups according to your needs. You must have permission to add resources to the selected resource group. If you don't have the required permission, contact the account owner to be assigned the Editor or Administrator role on a resource group in the account. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).

The resource group that you select cannot be changed after the instance is created.

### IAM access group
{: #vpc-vcf-ordering-adv-settings-iam}

Determines whether to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Access Group with an access policy for granting access to the resources deployed in your selected resource group. By default, it will not create the access group and access policy, but you can create them after the deployment. For more information about {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Access Group, see [Setting up access groups](/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=ui).
