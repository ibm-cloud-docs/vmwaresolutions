## Network MTU configuration settings
{: #vpc-vcf-ovw-bom-mtu-config}

The vSphere cluster has a single vSphere Distributed Switches (vDS) for public and for private network connectivity.

The private network connections are configured to use Jumbo Frames MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) with a size of 9000 (when applicable), which improves performance for large data transfers such as storage and vMotion. This value is the maximum MTU allowed within VMware and by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The public network connections use a standard Ethernet MTU of 1500, which must be maintained. Any changes might cause packet fragmentation over the internet.

Review the following table for an overview of the Network MTU configuration settings that are applied to the Virtual Distributed Switch, VMkernel adapters, and NSX Tier 0 uplinks.

| Configuration setting | Value |
| --------------------- | ----- |
| Virtual Distributed Switch | 9000 (Jumbo Frames) |
| VMkernel adapters for management | 1500 (Default) |
| VMkernel adapters for VSAN | 9000 (Jumbo Frames) |
| VMkernel adapters for vMotion | 9000 (Jumbo Frames) |
| VMkernel adapters for TEP traffic | 9000 (Jumbo Frames) |
| Tier 0 private uplinks | 9000 (Jumbo Frames) |
| Tier 0 public uplinks | 1500 (Default) |
{: caption="Table 3. MTU configuration settings for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}}" caption-side="bottom"}

NSX Global Gateway Configuration is set to MTU of 1500 for the router links and interfaces at the overlay.
