# Adding ESXi servers to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances
{: #vpc-vcf-host-adding}

You can increase or decrease the capacity of your deployment by adding or deleting hosts to and from a cluster.

## Before you add ESXi servers to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances
{: #vpc-vcf-host-adding-before}

* You can add hosts only when the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc}} instance is in **Available** status.
* You can add hosts only to one domain at a time.
* Ensure that the current user has access to the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} ({{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}) resources of the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instance to which you want to add ESXi servers.
* In a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} environment with a Consolidated architecture, the new VMware ESXi™ servers are added to the management cluster. In a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} environment with a Standard architecture, the new VMware ESXi™ servers can be added to both the management and the workload cluster.
* The new ESXi servers are configured with the same profile as the other servers in the cluster. vSAN storage is offered.
* When you add ESXi servers to your infrastructure, they are provisioned with the same version that was initially configured during the setup process. 
* Adding ESXi servers through automation is provided only for management and workload clusters in a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instance.
