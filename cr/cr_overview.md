# Cyber Recovery overview
{: #cr_overview}

The most critical aspects of your organization are your computer systems and networks and your data. You must protect them from threats.

Cyber resilience is the ability to avert, handle, and recover from various incidents that can damage or compromise your data or systems. You must be able to continue to provide your operations to your users. For more information, see [What is cyber resilience](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-resilience){: external}.

Cyber Recovery can help protect your data from cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and ransomware. This offering is for a single-zone VMware instance only. 

A Cyber Recovery instance includes the following components: 

* VMware vSphere® 7.0u3
* VMware NSX® 4.1
* Veeam Backup and Replication 12
* A Linux® hardened repository (LHR)
* An edge gateway

For the edge gateway, you can bring your own gateway appliance or choose from the following options:

* Gateway cluster with Juniper® vSRX
* Gateway cluster with FortiGate® Virtual Appliance
* FortiGate Security Appliance

When you order a Cyber Recovery instance, the add-on service that you choose as your firewall appliance is included as well.
