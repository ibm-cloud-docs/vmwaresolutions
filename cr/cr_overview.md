# Cyber Recovery overview
{: #cr_overview}

The most critical aspects of your organization are your computer systems and networks and your data. You must protect them from threats.

Cyber resilience is the ability to avert, handle, and recover from various incidents that can damage or compromise your data or systems. You must be able to continue to provide your operations to your users. For more information, see [What is cyber resilience](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-resilience){: external}.

Cyber Recovery can help protect your data from cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and ransomware. A Cyber Recovery instance includes Veeam Backup and  Replication 12, a Linux® hardened repository (LHR), and an edge gateway.

For the edge gateway, you can bring your own gateway appliance or choose from the following options:

* Gateway cluster with Juniper® vSRX
* Gateway cluster with FortiGate® Virtual Appliance
* FortiGate Security Appliance

VMware vSphere® 7.0u3 and VMware NSX-T™ 3.2 are automatically installed.

The offering is for a single-zone VMware instance only.

When you install Cyber Recovery, the Veeam add-on service and the add-on service that you choose as your firewall appliance are automatically included. When you edit Veeam to configure it, the Linux hardened repository is required and already selected.
