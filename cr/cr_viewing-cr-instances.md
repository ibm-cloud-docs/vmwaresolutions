Hover over **vCenter console** and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.
{: important}

Review the following topics for information to help you complete the login instructions:
*  For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to the vSphere Web Client](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_timeout_vc_console).
*  For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure Private Network by using VPN, see [VPN access](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpn-access){: external}.
