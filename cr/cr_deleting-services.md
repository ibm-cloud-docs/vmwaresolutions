## Manually removing the DNS entries for specific services
{: #cr_deletingservices-DNS-entries}

After you delete the service, unused DNS entries remain in Active Directory™. These entries do not cause any problems. However, in the future, they might create conflicts with reverse lookups. It is recommended that you remove the entries as soon as possible.

The following table shows the services that are affected and the pattern for hostnames for these services. The hostname might differ from the exact pattern displayed. Use the pattern to locate all the registered DNS hostnames associated with a service. Services might have more than one registered hostname.

| Service | Hostname Pattern | Example |
|:------- |:---------------- | :------ |
| Caveonix RiskForesight™ | `riskforesight` | `riskforesight` \n `inst01-riskforesight` |
| F5® BIG-IP® | `nickname-bigip1` \n `nickname-bigip2` | `edgefw-bigip1` |
| FortiGate Virtual Appliance | `nickname-fortigate` | `edgefw-fortigate01` |
| Entrust CloudControl™ | `htccnn-id` | `htcc02-GY67239` |
| vRealize Operations™ | `vrli` \n `vrops` \n `vrlog` | `vrli-master` \n `vrops-data1` \n `vrlog-master` |
{: caption="Table 1. Hostname patterns and examples for affected services" caption-side="bottom"}

To remove the DNS entires, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the Active Directory™ appliance and open the DNS tools.
2. Go to the instance subdomain, which is the subdomain under the root domain. Its name resembles the name of the Cyber Recovery instance.
3. Remove the hostname entries for the specific deleted service appliances.
4. Open the associated reverse lookup table and remove the DNS entries from the table.
