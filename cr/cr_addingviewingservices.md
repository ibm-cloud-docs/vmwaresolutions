# Ordering, viewing, and deleting services for Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_addingviewingservices}

You can order various add-on services for your Cyber Recovery instance. For example, [Caveonix RiskForesight](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-caveonix_considerations) is optional. 

When no longer needed, delete the added services from your instances.

The procedures to add, view, and delete services for Cyber Recovery instances are similar to the ones for VMware vCenter ServerÂ® instances. For more information, see the following topics:
