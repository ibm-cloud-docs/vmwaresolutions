# Adding NFS storage to Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_addingnfs}

You can expand the capacity of your Cyber Recovery instance according to your business needs by adding Network File System (NFS) storage.

## Before you add NFS storage to Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_addingnfs-prereq}

* Do not add NFS storage from the VMware vSphere® Web Client. The changes that you make on the vSphere Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console.
* {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} does not manage NFS file shares that you manually add to an instance.
* You can add or remove NFS storage shares to or from an existing NFS or vSAN™ cluster.
* If you mount {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Endurance NFS storage to your cluster, consider the following steps:
   * Ping the NFS server for the storage and note the subnet for the server IP address.
   * Review the VMKernel adapters for the hosts that use storage and make note of the subnet for vmk3. Use the [file storage list](https://cloud.ibm.com/cloud-storage/file){: external} to authorize the vmk3 subnet to access the NFS data store.
   * Review the static routes defined on the hosts with the `esxcli network ip route ipv4 list` command. A static route must be displayed for the NFS server IP subnet to the gateway for the vmk3 subnet listed in the previous step.

## Procedure to add NFS storage to Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_addingnfs-procedure}

1. From the VMware Solutions console, click **Resources > Cyber Recovery** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **Cyber Recovery** table, click the instance for which you want to expand capacity.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab.
4. In the **Clusters** table, click the cluster to which you want to add NFS storage.
5. In the **Storage** section, click **Add**.
6. In the **Add NFS storage** side panel, complete the storage configuration.
   * If you want to add and configure the same settings to all file shares, specify the **Number of shares**, **Size (GB)**, and **Performance**.
   * If you want to add and configure file shares individually, toggle the **Configure shares individually** switch on, then click **Add shared storage** and select the **Size (GB)** and **Performance** for each individual file share. You must select at least one file share. For more information, see [NFS storage](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_orderinginstance-consoldworkldcluster-settings#vc_orderinginstance-nfs-storage).
7. Review the estimated price and click **Add**.

## Results after you add NFS storage to Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_addingnfs-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console while the instance status changes from **Available** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to complete before you make more changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email that your request to add NFS storage is being processed. On the console, the status of the cluster that is associated with the NFS storage is changed to **Modifying**.
3. If you do not see that the new NFS storage is added to the list in the cluster, check the email or console notifications to find more details about the failure.
