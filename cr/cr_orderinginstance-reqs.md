# Requirements for Cyber Recovery
{: #cr_orderinginstance_reqs}

Cyber Recovery helps you with data protection, cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and ransomware. The instance includes the Veeam Backup and Replication 12 add-on service and a Linux® hardened repository (LHR). An edge gateway is required and you can provide your own or order one of the following edges:

* Juniper® vSRX
* FortiGate® Virtual Appliance
* FortiGate Security Appliance

You can order add-on services. For more information, see [Services for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Cyber Recovery](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-cr_planning#cr_planning-addon-services).

Price calculations are automatically generated when you access the Cyber Recovery instance order page. Default selections include the Data Center SP Professional license for NSX-T™, the Dual Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8260 processor / 48 cores, 2.4 GHz CPU model, 768 GB RAM, and NFS storage for both the consolidated and workload clusters.

Ensure that you complete the following tasks:
* If you are ordering an instance for the first time, complete the tasks in the **Before you begin** section on the ordering page. For more information, see [Setting up your environment for your first order](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-completing_checklist).
* Review the information in [Signing up for required accounts](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-signing_required_accounts).
* Review the information in [Cyber Recovery overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-cr_overview).
* Review the domain name format. The domain name is used to generate the username and server names of the instance.

| Name        | Value format |
|:------------|:------------ |
| Domain name | `<root_domain>` (Microsoft® Active Directory™ domain name) |
| vCenter Server login username | `<user_id>@<root_domain>` (Microsoft Active Directory user) or `administrator@vsphere.local` |
| vCenter Server (with embedded PSC) FQDN | `<instance_name>-vc.<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 50 characters. Any hyphen (-) characters from the instance name are removed. |
| Single Sign-On (SSO) site name | `<root_domain>` |
| Fully qualified ESXi server name | `<host_prefix><n>.<root_domain>`, where `n` is the sequence of the VMware vSphere® ESXi™ server. The maximum length is 50 characters. |
| NetBIOS name | First string of `<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 15 characters. |
