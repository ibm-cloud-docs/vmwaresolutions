# Deleting clusters from Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_deletingclusters}

You can delete clusters from Cyber Recovery instances when you do not need them.

## Before you delete clusters from Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_deletingclusters-before}

* Whenever possible, delete clusters by using the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console because changes that you make on the VMware vSphereÂ® Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console. Therefore, delete clusters from Cyber Recovery only for on-premises clusters or clusters that you don't plan to manage in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
* You can delete only clusters that are added as part of Day 2 operations. Clusters that are created during initial deployment can't be deleted.
* You can delete a single cluster at a time. To delete more than one cluster, you must do it in sequence. Wait for the previous cluster to be deleted before you delete the next cluster.
* Ensure that all nodes in a cluster are powered on and operational before you delete the cluster.
* You can add or delete a cluster while another cluster is being created or deleted.
* When you delete a cluster, all virtual machines (VMs) from the cluster are also deleted, and they can't be recovered. If you want to keep the VMs, migrate them to other clusters.
* You do not have to delete any services that are installed on the cluster, including services on an edge gateway cluster. The services are automatically deleted when you delete the cluster.
