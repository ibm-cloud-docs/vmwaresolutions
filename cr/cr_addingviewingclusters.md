# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for Cyber Recovery instances
{: #cr_addingviewingclusters}

You can add clusters to Cyber Recovery instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage VMware vSphere® ESXi™ servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

The procedures to add, view, and delete clusters for Cyber Recovery instances are similar to the ones for VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see the following topics:
* [Adding clusters to vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingclusters)
* [Viewing clusters for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewingclusters)
* [Deleting clusters from vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletingclusters)
