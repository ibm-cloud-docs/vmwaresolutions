# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for {{site.data.keyword.cr}} instances
{: #cr_addingviewingclusters}



You can add clusters to {{site.data.keyword.cr}} instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage VMware vSphere ESXi™ servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

The procedures to add, view, and delete clusters for {{site.data.keyword.cr}} instances are similar to the ones for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instances. For more information, see the following topics:
