# Deleting vSphere clusters
{: #vs_deletingclusters}

Since the VMware® vSphere clusters are not displayed on the Resources page in the VMware Solutions console, you must manage the resources yourself.

If you cancel a host, check for other resources that must be canceled, including licenses. For example, you might cancel licenses, such as VMware vSAN™, VMware NSX®, VMware vRealize Operations™ (vROps), and VMware vRealize Log Insight™ (vRLI). If you cannot determine which resources are associated with a particular host, then open a support ticket.
