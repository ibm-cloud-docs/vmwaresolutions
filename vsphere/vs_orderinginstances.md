# Ordering new vSphere clusters

To deploy a highly customizable VMware virtualized platform, order VMware vSphere on IBM Cloud. Use this procedure to define a new cluster.

This workflow will guide you through VMware component, bare metal server, and networking choices, to create a new cluster. After you place the order, the cluster configuration is captured so that you can come back and continue to scale out the cluster as needed. Once the order is completed, you can manually build the VMware cluster based on your requirements.

## Requirements

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
*  You configured the IBM Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [User accounts and settings](../vmonic/useraccount.html).
*  You meet the requirements and you reviewed the considerations in [Requirements and planning for vSphere clusters](vs_planning.html).

## Main settings

When you order a new vSphere cluster, you must specify the following settings.

<!--**Important: Do not modify any values that are set during ordering and cluster deployment. Doing so can result in your cluster becoming unusable.**-->

### Cluster Configurations

Ensure that **New cluster** is selected in the **Cluster Configurations** list when you configure a new cluster.

### Cluster Name

The cluster name must be unique within your account.

### Domain Name

The domain name is used for all bare metal server orders and must meet the following requirements:
* The name must consist of two or more strings that are separated by period (.)
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* Each string must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character, and the last string can contain only
alphabetic characters.
* The length of the last string must be in the range 2 - 24 characters.
* The length of other strings must be in the range 1 - 63 characters.
* The maximum length of the domain name is 189 characters.

### Host Name Prefix

The host name is used for all bare metal server orders. It is recommended to use the host name for all management virtual machines, such as vCenter Server, NSX, and so on.

The host name prefix must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* It must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length is 10 characters.

## VMware Components

You can select the following VMware components to be ordered with your cluster:
* VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus
* VMware vCenter Server
* VMware NSX
* VMware vSAN. When you order this component, you must select the **Number of Disks** in the **Bare Metal Servers** section.
* VMware Site Recovery Manager
* VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise
* VMware vRealize Operation Enterprise
* VMware vRealize Log Insight

You have the following options for licensing the selected VMware components:
* **Include license with purchase**: In this case, a new license for the VMware component is purchased on your behalf. A combined VMware license is generated to match the cluster size of the order.
* **I will provide the license**: In this case, you will use your own license for the VMware component.

If you choose to purchase any license, except for vSphere Enterprise Plus and vCenter Server, and you order multiple ESXi servers, a Bluemix
Infrastructure (Softlayer) ticket is opened automatically on your behalf to combine license keys. You are responsible to follow up with the ticket to ensure that you use only the license keys that the DevOps team generates.

**Important**: Using individual license keys together with the combined license keys does not meet the payment requirements for the licenses you will need.

## Bare Metal Servers

Review the following details about your order, depending on whether you choose to order the **VMware vSAN** component or not:
* For orders without vSAN, ESXi servers are ordered with a 4-disk chassis, with 2 disks for the ESXi operating system (OS)
* For orders with vSAN, ESXi servers are ordered with a 12-disk chassis and four disks ordered: two for the ESXi OS and two reserved for caching (these settings are configured by default and cannot be changed). You can order more capacity disks by selecting the **Number of Disks** in the **Bare Metal Servers** section.
* For additional information about storage calculations depending on your other selections, see the details displayed under **vSAN Summary** on the console.

### Data Center Location

Select the IBM Cloud data center where the cluster is to be hosted.

### Number of Disks

The number of disks values are displayed only for the VMware vSAN component. The disk quantity options include 2, 4, 6, and 8.

### Disk Capacity

This value is set to 1.2 TB SSD (10 DWPD) and cannot be changed.

### CPU model

The following CPU models are available for bare metal servers:
* Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.10 GHz
* Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.20 GHz
* Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.60 GHz

### RAM

The RAM options include 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1 TB, and 1.5 TB. Options available depend on whether you selected the VMware vSAN component.

### Number of Bare Metal Servers

The number of ESXi servers that you want add to the vSphere cluster. All the ESXi servers share the same configuration.
* If you selected the VMware NSX component, a minimum of 3 servers is required.
* If you selected the VMware vSAN component, a minimum of 4 servers is required.

## Network Details

One public VLAN and two private VLANs are required for your cluster order. The two private VLANs are trunked into each bare metal server.

Depending on the data center you selected, existing public and private VLANs might be available.
* If you want to reuse existing public and private VLANs, click **Select Existing Public and Private VLANs** and choose from the available VLANs and subnets. Ensure that all the VLANs chosen are in the same pod, because ESXi servers cannot be provisioned on mixed-pod VLANs.

  To find out what the pod ID of a VLAN, review the VLAN format on the user interface. The format is `<bcr/fcr><pod id>.<datacenter shortname>.<vlan number>`. For example, for a private VLAN, the VLAN ID might be `bcr01a.mex01.1247` and for a public VLAN, the ID might be `fcr01a.mex01.1253`. In both these examples, the pod ID is `01a`.

* When no existing VLANs are available, one new public VLAN and two private VLANs are provisioned.

You can also select whether to include FortiGate Physical Appliance 300 Series HA Pair in your cluster.

## Procedure

1. Click **Getting Started** or **Order Instance** from the left navigation pane.
2. On the **VMware vSphere** card, click **Order Instance**. Ensure that you are on the **Create new cluster** tab and that **New cluster** is displayed in the **Cluster Configurations** list.
3. Enter the cluster name.
4. Enter the root domain name.
5. Enter the ESXi server name prefix.
6. Under **VMware Components**, complete the following steps:
   1. Select the VMware vSphere version from the **VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus** list, and then specify the licensing option for it
    as follows:
      * If you want new licenses for this VMware component to be purchased on your behalf, select **Include license with purchase**.
      * If you want to use your own VMware licenses for this VMware component, select **I will provide the license**. A Bluemix
      Infrastructure ticket is opened automatically on your behalf to request the default vSphere licenses on your ordered
      bare metal servers to be replaced with your provided licenses.

      **Important**: You are responsible to follow up with the ticket to ensure that you replace the vSphere license on the newly ordered ESXi servers so that Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) grants the cancellation of the initially provided Bluemix Infrastructure vSphere license charge. To replace your ESXi vSphere license, see [Configure License Settings for an ESXi Host](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-1B128360-0060-40F2-A6F0-43CD2534B034.html){:new_window}.

   2. Select other VMware components that you want to integrate with your cluster, specify the licensing options for them as
    follows, and select the edition for them if the option list is available:
      * If you want a new license to be purchased on your behalf for a component, select **Include license with purchase**.
      * If you want to use your own VMware license for a component, select **I will provide the license**.
7. Under **Bare Metal Servers**, complete the following steps:
   1. Select the IBM Cloud data center to host the cluster.
   2. If you selected the VMware vSAN component, select the number of disks and review the disk capacity.
   3. Select the CPU model.
   4. Select the RAM size.
   5. Select the number of bare metal servers to add to the cluster.
8. Under **Network Details**, complete the following steps:
   1. If you want to reuse the existing public and private VLANs when they are available, click **Select Existing Public and Private VLANs**, and then select the public VLAN, the primary subnet, the private VLAN, the primary private subnet, and the secondary private VLAN.
   2. If you want new public and private VLANs to be provisioned, do not click **Select Existing Public and Private VLANs**.
   3. If you want a FortiGate high availability (HA) appliance to be installed on the public VLAN, select **Include with purchase** under
   **FortiGate Physical Appliance 300 Series HA Pair**.
9. Click **Next**.
10. On the **Summary** page, verify the cluster configuration before you place the order.
   1. Review the settings for the cluster.
   2. Click the link or links of the terms that apply to your order, and ensure that you agree with these terms before you continue.
   3. Review the estimated cost of the cluster by clicking the price link under **Estimated Cost**. To save or print your order
   summary, click the **Print** or **Download** icon on the upper right of the PDF window.
   4. To save the cluster configuration as a template without placing an order, click **Save Configuration**.
   5. To place the order, click **Place Order**.

## Results

If you saved the cluster configuration as a template, you get a console notification that the configuration is saved successfully, and then you can find the template in the **Cluster Configurations** list on the **Basics** page.

If you placed an order, the deployment of the cluster starts automatically, and you receive an email confirmation that the order is being processed. When the cluster is ready to use, you are notified by email.

**Note**: Only the bare metals are ordered. You are responsible for installing and configuring various components after cluster deployment, such as VMware vCenter, VMware NSX, VMware vSAN.
