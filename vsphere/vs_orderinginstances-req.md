# Requirements for VMware vSphere
{: #vs_orderinginstances-req}

To deploy a highly customizable VMware速 virtualized platform, order a VMware vSphere速 instance.

Select VMware components, {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} bare metal server settings, storage settings, and networking choices, to create a new instance. After you place the order, the instance configuration is captured so that you can come back and continue to scale out the instance as needed. After the order is completed, you can manually configure the VMware vSphere instance based on your requirements.

Price calculations are automatically generated when you access the VMware vSphere instance order page. Default selections include the Dual Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8260 processor / 48 cores, 2.4 GHz CPU model, and 768 GB RAM.

Ensure that you complete the following tasks:
* If you are ordering a VMware vSphere instance for the first time, complete the tasks in the **Before you begin** section on the ordering page. For more information, see [Setting up your environment for your first order](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-completing_checklist).
* Review the requirements and considerations in [Planning for VMware vSphere](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_planning).
