# Requirements for vSphere clusters
{: #vs_orderinginstances-req}

To deploy a highly customizable VMware® virtualized platform, order a VMware vSphere® cluster.

This procedure guides you through the selection of VMware components, {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} bare metal server settings, storage settings, and networking choices, to create a new cluster. After you place the order, the cluster configuration is captured so that you can come back and continue to scale out the cluster as needed. After the order is completed, you can manually configure the VMware vSphere cluster based on your requirements.

Ensure that you complete the following tasks:
* If you are ordering an instance for the first time, complete the tasks in the **Before you begin** section on the ordering page. For more information, see [Setting up your environment for your first order](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-completing_checklist).
* Review the requirements and considerations in [Requirements and planning for vSphere clusters](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_planning).
