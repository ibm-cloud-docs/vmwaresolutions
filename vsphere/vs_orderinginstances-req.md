# Requirements for Flexible instances
{: #vs_orderinginstances-req}

To deploy a highly customizable VMware® virtualized platform, order a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex}} instance.

Select VMware components, {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} bare metal server settings, storage settings, and networking choices, to create a new instance. After you place the order, the instance configuration is captured so that you can come back and continue to scale out the instance as needed. After the order is completed, you can manually configure the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}} instance based on your requirements.

Price calculations are automatically generated when you access the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}} instance order page. Default selections include the Dual Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8260 processor / 48 cores, 2.4 GHz CPU model, and 768 GB RAM.

Ensure that you complete the following tasks:
* If you are ordering a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}} instance for the first time, complete the tasks in the **Before you begin** section on the ordering page. For more information, see [Setting up your environment for your first order](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-completing_checklist).
* Review the requirements and considerations in [Planning for Flexible instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_planning).
