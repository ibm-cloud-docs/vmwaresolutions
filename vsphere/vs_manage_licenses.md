# Managing licenses for Flexible instances
{: #vs_manage_licenses}

Managing licenses for Flexible instances is supported only for IBM-provided licenses. It does not apply to BYOL (Bring Your Own License).
{: important}

You can add licenses for various VMware components in your {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex}} instance. For more information about these components, see [Licensing](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_orderinginstances-licensing-settings).

## Before you manage licenses for Flexible instances
{: #vs_manage_licenses-prereq}

* For instances with VMware vSphere 6, you cannot add licenses. To add licenses, upgrade your vSphere software to version 7. For more information, see [Upgrading vSphere software from vSphere 6.5 or 6.7 to 7.0](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphere_70_upgrade).
* The VMware vSAN license is part of your instance by default and it cannot be deleted.
* If you want to combine license keys, open an IBM Support ticket by following the steps in [Getting help and support](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_support).
