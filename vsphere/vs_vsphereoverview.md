# Overview of {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}}
{: #vs_vsphereoverview}

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex}} is a streamlined and optimized ordering platform for VMware®. With this platform, you can build your own {{site.data.keyword.IBM}}-hosted VMware environment by customizing and ordering the VMware-compatible hardware based on your selected VMware components.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console filters the hardware automatically, based on the VMware components that you select. For example, when you create a new all-flash VMware vSAN™ cluster, only the hardware that is validated against the [Broadcom Compatibility Guide](https://compatibilityguide.broadcom.com/){: external} is presented.

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex}} does not automate the installation, configuration, and bring-up of the optional VMware components. The platform allows maximum of flexibility to design and build your hosted VMware environment while you incorporate VMware-compatible hardware.

Use this offering to create a new instance of VMware ESXi™ servers or scale out an existing instance of ESXi servers in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. Depending on the VMware components that you select, you can start with just one ESXi server and then scale the instance later as needed.

## Technical specifications for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}}
{: #vs_vsphereoverview-specs}

Review the components for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}} instances.

The availability and pricing of standardized hardware configurations might vary based on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center that is selected for deployment.

## Technical specifications for expansion nodes for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}}
{: #vs_vsphereoverview-expansion-node-specs}

Each {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}} instance expansion node deploys and incurs charges for the following components in your {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} account.

### Hardware for expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereoverview-expansion-node-specs-hardware}

One {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server with the hardware configuration presented in [Technical specifications for Flexible instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphereoverview#vs_vsphereoverview-specs).

### Networking for expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereoverview-expansion-node-specs-network}

One {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server with the networking configuration presented in [Technical specifications for Flexible instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphereoverview#vs_vsphereoverview-specs).

### VMware components for expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereoverview-expansion-node-specs-vmware-components}

* One {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server with VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus 7.0 or 6.7u3 for V4.7 and earlier.
* Optional VMware components presented in [Technical specifications for Flexible instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphereoverview#vs_vsphereoverview-specs).

You must manage the ESXi servers, optional VMware components, and extra hardware that is ordered and delivered to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account only from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. After you create a new instance in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you can return to the console, and add capacity to the new instance.
