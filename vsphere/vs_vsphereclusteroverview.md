# VMware vSphere overview
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview}

VMware vSphere® is a streamlined and optimized ordering platform for VMware®. With this platform, you can build your own {{site.data.keyword.IBM}}-hosted VMware environment by customizing and ordering the VMware-compatible hardware based on your selected VMware components.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console filters the hardware automatically, based on the VMware components that you select. For example, when you create a new all-flash VMware vSAN™ cluster, only the hardware that is validated against the [VMware Compatibility Guide](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php){: external} is presented.

VMware vSphere does not automate the installation, configuration, and bring-up of the optional VMware components. The platform allows maximum of flexibility to design and build your hosted VMware environment while you incorporate VMware-compatible hardware.

Use this offering to create a new cluster of VMware ESXi™ servers or scale out an existing cluster of ESXi servers in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. Depending on the VMware components that you select, you can start with just one ESXi server and then scale the cluster later as needed.

## Technical specifications for VMware vSphere clusters
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs}

Review the components of VMware vSphere.

The availability and pricing of standardized hardware configurations might vary based on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center that is selected for deployment.
{: note}

### VMware components
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs-vmware-components}

Select licenses (IBM-provided or BYOL) for the following VMware components:
* VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus 7.0u2 or 6.7u3
* The following VMware components are optional:
   * VMware vCenter Server® Standard
   * VMware NSX® (Base, Advanced, or Enterprise)
   * VMware vSAN (Advanced or Enterprise)
   * VMware Site Recovery Manager
   * VMware vRealize® Automation Enterprise
   * VMware vRealize Operations™ Enterprise
   * VMware vRealize Log Insight™

### Bare metal server
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs-bare-metal}

You can order one or more {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal servers with one of the following configurations:
* **Cascade Lake** - 2-CPU Intel® Cascade Lake generation servers (Intel Xeon® 4200/5200/6200/8200 series) and 4-CPU Intel Cascade Lake generation servers (Quad Intel Xeon Gold 6248 and Quad Intel Xeon Platinum 8260). Each with your selected CPU model and RAM size.
* **Skylake** - 2-CPU Intel Skylake generation servers (Intel Xeon 4100/5100/6100 series) with your selected CPU model and RAM size.
* **SAP-certified** - 2-CPU Intel Skylake generation servers Intel Cascade Lake generation servers (Intel Xeon Gold 5200/6200 series and Intel Xeon Platinum 8200 series) with your selected CPU model.

Additionally, the following disk and networking specifications apply:
* 10 Gbps dual public and private network uplinks
* One RAID disk controller

### Bare metal server notes
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs-bare-metal-notes}

* Skylake servers are not supported for vSphere Enterprise Plus 7.0 instances.
* The options available depend on whether you selected the VMware vSAN component.

### Networking
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs-network}

* One VLAN (Virtual LAN) public VLAN and two private VLANs
* (Optional) An HA-pair of FortiGate® Physical Appliance devices

### Storage
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs-storage}

User-customized storage for vSAN configuration when the VMware vSAN component is selected:
* Storage disk options - 960 GB SSD SED, 1.9 TB SSD SED, 3.8 TB SSD SED, or 7.68 TB SSD SED.
* Disk quantity options - 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.

   Additionally, two cache disks of 960 GB are also ordered per host.

   3.8 TB SSD (Solid-State Disk) drives are supported when they are made generally available in a data center.
   {: note}

* High Performance with Intel Optane - this option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of ten capacity disks. It's available only for vSphere 6 instances, and for Skylake and dual-processor Cascade Lake CPU models.

## Technical specifications for vSphere cluster expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-expansion-node-specs}

Each vSphere cluster expansion node deploys and incurs charges for the following components in your {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} account.

### Hardware for expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-expansion-node-specs-hardware}

One {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server with the hardware configuration presented in [Technical specifications for VMware vSphere clusters](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphereclusteroverview#vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs).

### Networking for expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-expansion-node-specs-network}

One {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server with the networking configuration presented in [Technical specifications for VMware vSphere clusters](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphereclusteroverview#vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs).

### VMware components for expansion nodes
{: #vs_vsphereclusteroverview-expansion-node-specs-vmware-components}

* One {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server with VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus 7.0 or 6.7u3.  
* Optional VMware components presented in [Technical specifications for VMware vSphere clusters](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphereclusteroverview#vs_vsphereclusteroverview-specs).

You must manage the ESXi servers, optional VMware components, and extra hardware that is ordered and delivered to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account only from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. After you create a new cluster in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you can return to the console and use the saved information to scale the new cluster. For more information, see [Scaling existing vSphere clusters](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_scalingexistingclusters).
