# Licensing
{: #vs_orderinginstances-licensing-settings}

Select the VMware® components for your instance and specify the licensing option for them.



## Licensing options
{: #vs_orderinginstances-licensing-options}


You have the following options for licensing the selected VMware components:
* **Include license with purchase**: In this case, a new license for the VMware component is purchased on your behalf. A combined VMware license is generated to match the instance size of the order.

   When you purchase any license, except for VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus and VMware vCenter Server, and you order multiple VMware ESXi™ servers, an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ticket is opened automatically to combine license keys. You are responsible to follow up with the ticket to ensure that you use only the license keys that the VMware Solutions Support team generates.

* **Bring your own license (BYOL)**: If you are a BYOL user, provide your own license key for vSphere Enterprise Plus edition. Toggle the **BYOL** switch to **Enabled** and enter your license key.
