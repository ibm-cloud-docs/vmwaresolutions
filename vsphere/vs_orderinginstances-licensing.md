## Licensing options
{: #vs_orderinginstances-licensing-options}

Using individual license keys together with the combined license keys does not meet the payment requirements for the licenses you need.
{: important}

You have the following options for licensing the selected VMware components:
* **Include license with purchase**: In this case, a new license for the VMware component is purchased on your behalf. A combined VMware license is generated to match the cluster size of the order.

   When you purchase any license, except for vSphere Enterprise Plus and vCenter Server, and you order multiple VMware ESXi™ servers, an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ticket is opened automatically to combine license keys. You are responsible to follow up with the ticket to ensure that you use only the license keys that the VMware Solutions Support team generates.

* **I will provide the license**: Bring your own license (BYOL) is no longer allowed for VMware components except if you are migrating or upgrading an existing BYOL cluster. If you are upgrading your cluster, do not enter your BYOL licenses when you create your order for the first time, but do it later when the vSphere cluster is created.
