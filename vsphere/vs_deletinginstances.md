# Deleting Flexible instances
{: #vs_deletinginstance}

{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

When you delete a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex}} instance, the VMware® product licenses and the VMware ESXi™ servers are released.

Because of resource dependencies, the ESXi servers in your instance might not be released until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle. At the end of the billing cycle, which is typically 30 days, the instance deletion is completed.

{{site.data.content.deletinginstance-important-note}}

The instance remains in **Deleting** status and the monthly ESXi servers are available for the remainder of the account monthly billing cycle. After the billing cycle ends, the status of the device changes from **ACTIVE** to **RECLAIM** until the reclaim process completes which can take days or weeks into the following month.

After the ESXi server reclaim process completes, the instance deletion is completed.

You can review the next account invoice to confirm that you are no longer billed for the deleted instance. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage > Billing and usage** and click **Invoices**.
