## High Performance with Intel Optane option

This release provides the option to add high-performance cache for vSAN storage when you are ordering a new instance or when you add a new vSAN cluster after initial deployment.

This option allows you to increase the number of storage capacity disks from eight to a maximum of ten.

The High Performance with Intel Optane option is available only for customized configurations with Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140 processors.

For more information, see the appropriate ordering topic for your instance or cluster type.

## Enabling a public or private network

You can now deploy vCenter Server and vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances, as well as VMware vSphere clusters, with public and private network interface cards (NICs) enabled or private only NICs enabled. This option is also available when you add a new cluster to your vCenter Server and vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance.

Some add-on services require public NICs and are not available if you select to enable a private only network.

For more information, see the _Network interface settings_ section in the following topics:

* [Ordering vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_orderinginstance#network-interface-settings)
* [Ordering vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_orderinginstance#network-interface-settings)
* [Ordering new vSphere clusters](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vsphere?topic=vmware-solutions-vs_orderinginstances#network-interface-settings)

## Deleting ESXi servers

You can now delete any ESXi server from your vCenter Server, vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle, or Cloud Foundation instance if you meet the minimum requirements for your instance.

For more information on ESXi server requirements, see the following topics:

* [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_addingremovingservers)
* [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_addingremovingservers)

## Updates for add-on services

### HyTrust KeyControl on IBM Cloud

The HyTrust KeyControl on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service is now available to VMware Cloud Foundation instances and VMware vCenter Server instances that are running vSphere 6.5 and that are deployed in or upgraded to V2.5 and later releases. The service simplifies the management of encrypted workloads by automating and simplifying the lifecycle of encryption keys. The service can easily manage encryption keys at scale by using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption. By using this service, you can manage the encryption keys for all your virtual machines and encrypted data stores, and scale it to support thousands of encrypted workloads in large deployments.

You can order instances with the service included when you order your instance, or add this service to your existing instances later.
