# Release notes for V2.0

This release includes new features, component updates, usability enhancements, and bug fixes. For a list of fixed issues in different releases, known issues with the product, and additional tips to use {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/cloudvmw/){:new_window}.

## FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud

The FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud service is now available to V2.0 and later VMware Cloud Foundation instances and VMware vCenter Server instances. This service deploys a high-availability (HA) pair of FortiGate Virtual Appliances to your environment, which can help you to reduce risk by implementing critical security controls within your virtual infrastructure.

You can order instances with the FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud service included when you order your instance, or add this service to your existing instances later from the **Services** tab on the instance details page. Depending on your requirements, you can select one of three deployment sizes and licensing options for this service. After the service is installed successfully, you can manage and configure firewall rules for the FortiGate Virtual Appliances from the FortiGate console.

For more information, see:
* [Components and considerations for FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud](../services/fortinetvm_considerations.html)
* [Managing FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud](../services/managingfortinetvm.html)

## Multiple service installation for F5 on IBM Cloud and FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud

You can now install multiple instances of the F5 on IBM Cloud service and the FortiGate Virtual Appliance on IBM Cloud service for a Cloud Foundation instance or a vCenter Server instance. When you select the F5 service or the FortiGate service during instance ordering, you must specify a name for the service instance to distinguish it from the additional service instances that you install later on.

After the instance deployment is completed, you can add more instances of the F5 or the FortiGate service by installing the service on the **Add Services** tab of the instance details page. You can add only one service instance at a time, and you must repeat the process for all the instances that you want to add for a service.

For more information, see:
* [Ordering, viewing, and removing services for Cloud Foundation instances](../sddc/sd_addingremovingservices.html)
* [Ordering, viewing, and removing services for vCenter Server instances](../vcenter/vc_addingremovingservices.html)

## Updates for FortiGate Security Appliance on IBM Cloud

In this release, the Fortinet on IBM Cloud service is renamed to FortiGate Security Appliance on IBM Cloud, and the pair of FortiGate Security Appliances (FSAs) of the service is configured to be secure by default when they are deployed to your instance:
* If you deploy a pair of FSAs as part of a new Cloud Foundation instance or vCenter Server instance, the FSAs are configured to allow only the required outbound communications from your instance to the public network and deny all other communications.
* If you deploy a pair of FSAs as part of an existing Cloud Foundation instance or vCenter Server instance, the FSAs are configured with an explicit rule to allow all the required outbound management communications from your instance to the public network, and the FSAs are also configured with an additional rule to allow all other communications to ensure that your existing application traffic is not interrupted.

In all cases, you must manage the FSAs configuration carefully to allow only necessary communications and deny all other communications.

## Fully-qualified domain name format consistency

The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is now represented in a consistent way for all instances. When you place an order, you can enter your own subdomain prefix and host name prefix. This ensures that the industry convention for the FQDN format is followed, such as: `host-name-prefix<n>.subdomain-prefix.domain-name`.

For more information on components, see [Cloud Foundation overview](../sddc/sd_cloudfoundationoverview.html).

### Cluster support for Cloud Foundation instances

You can now use clusters to manage ESXi servers in Cloud Foundation instances that are deployed in V2.0 and later releases for better resource management and high availability. The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped as **SDDC-Cluster** by default.

You can view the cluster details or add up to a total of five clusters to an instance on the **Infrastructure** tab of the instance details page. When you are expanding or contracting capacity for an instance, you can select which cluster to add ESXi servers to or to remove ESXi servers from. For more information, see [Adding and viewing clusters for Cloud Foundation instances](../sddc/sd_addingviewingclusters.html).

### Support for custom vSAN storage for Cloud Foundation instances

You can now customize the vSAN storage configuration by selecting the number and size of the vSAN storage drives as part of your instance order.

For more information, see:
* [Cloud Foundation overview](../sddc/sd_cloudfoundationoverview.html)
* [Ordering Cloud Foundation instances](../sddc/sd_orderinginstance.html)

### Choice of VMware vSAN license edition for Cloud Foundation instances: Advanced or Enterprise

You can now select the vSAN license edition that you want during the Cloud Foundation instance order. You can either purchase the license as part of your order, or Bring Your Own License (BYOL). For more information, see [Ordering Cloud Foundation instances](../sddc/sd_orderinginstance.html).

### New standardized IBM Bare Metal Server configurations for Cloud Foundation instances
