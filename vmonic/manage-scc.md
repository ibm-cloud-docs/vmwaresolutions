## Monitoring security and compliance posture with VMware Solutions by using Caveonix
{: #manage-scc-monitor}

With VMware Solutions, you can optionally use [Caveonix RiskForesight service](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-caveonix_considerations) to report security and compliance posture and findings to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

This integration requires you to [establish a public connection](/docs/security-advisor?topic=security-advisor-setup-caveonix#connect-caveonix) from RiskForesight™ to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and [schedule a job](/docs/security-advisor?topic=security-advisor-setup-caveonix#caveonix-job) to periodically report findings.

RiskForesight reports a compliance and security posture summary to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, and a categorized list of cyberrisk findings. Details of these findings are visible both in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and in RiskForesight.

As a security or compliance focal, you can use this information to ensure that your organization is adhering to the external and internal standards for your industry. You can also identify potential issues as they arise.
