# End of Support for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} deployments
{: #eos-vmware-shared}

{{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} is no longer available for new deployments. Existing instances are supported until 15 January 2025. Migrate all your {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} resources to [{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_full}}](/docs/vmware-service) by 15 January 2025.
{: deprecated}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} will end on 15 January 2025. As stated in [End of Support for NSX-V instance deployments](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-eos-nsx-v), IBM’s exclusive support extension for VMware® NSX-V will end on 15 January 2025.


Because {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} uses NSX-V as the underlying networking software, it will no longer be supported.

The upgraded replacement for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} is {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas-full}}, the next generation IBM-managed VMware Cloud Director offering. IBM® strongly recommends that you migrate your workloads to [{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}](/docs/vmware-service).

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} is based on VMware NSX-T software and is provided at near-identical [pricing](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-eos-vmware-shared#eos-vmware-shared-pricing). As of December 2024, {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} multitenant is available in 7 {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} regions, with more regions being added periodically.

As of 28 March 2024, new orders for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} instances are not accepted. If you are an existing customer, you can continue to use your {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} deployments until 15 January 2025. However, IBM strongly recommends that you immediately assess your workloads and plan your migration to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers secure, simple, and cost-effective onboarding and migration options: either self-service or assisted. For more information, see [Migrating from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_migration).

## Pricing changes to consider when you migrate to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} multitenant
{: #eos-vmware-shared-pricing}

Review the following pricing considerations:

* The prices for vCPU and RAM are rebalanced for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} multitenant to enable more cost-effective scaling of RAM.
* {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} multitenant uses vSAN-backed Block Storage for Veeam, while the legacy {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} offering uses the less expensive 0.25 IOPS File Storage. This difference results in a net increase in price for Veeam Block Storage when you migrate.
* On-demand Base Charge is not applicable for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}, as it is replaced by the newly introduced network edge tiers. Network edge charges apply to both on-demand and reserved usage.
* The following options are available for [network edges](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared-vmwaas-migration#shared-vmwaas-migration-edge-type): Efficiency, Medium, Large, and Extra Large. Most customers require an Efficiency edge for their first virtual data center, which is price-matched with the Base Charge in {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}.

For more information about pricing, see the [{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} About page](/vmware/vmware_as_a_service/provision/vdc_mt#about).

## Migration considerations
{: #eos-vmware-shared-consider}

Since {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} is based on VMware Cloud Director, it retains the same console that is used for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}. You benefit from performance improvements, greater global coverage, and a small price rebalancing, which make {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} the ideal landing zone for your workloads.

Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} multitenant includes different options for network edges: an Efficiency edge, and three types of Performance edges.

Depending on the size and complexity of your workloads, you can migrate them by using a self-service migration tool. If you need assistance, you can choose a partner to help with some migration activities or ask them to do a full migration for you.
