# FAQ about End of Support for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}
{: #faq-vmwaresolutions-shared-eos}

{{site.data.content.shared-deprecated-note}}

Find answers to frequently asked questions about the End of Support for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} deployments.

## What does the End of Support announcement mean?
{: #faq-shared-eos}
{: faq}

If you are an existing customer, support for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} deployments will continue until 28 February 2025 after which access to workloads will end.

It is recommended that you deploy any new instances on the next-generation multitenant offering {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas-full}}. {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} is based on the same underlying software VMware Cloud Director, which retains the same admin console. You also benefit from performance improvements, options of network edge tier, improved private networking through {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}, greater regional coverage, and minor rebalancing in pricing. All these benefits make {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} the ideal landing zone for your workloads.

If you are new to {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}, and don't have any existing deployments, you are not able to provision new instances of {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}. You can use the next-generation performance that is offered by {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}, with on-demand pricing (hourly) and discounted reserved usage (monthly). For more discounts for continued use, contact your {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} seller.

## Why is the support for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} ending?
{: #faq-shared-eos-support}
{: faq}
{: support}

It is important to understand that {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} is based on VMware NSX-V, which is no longer supported by VMware® by Broadcom. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s exclusive contract with Broadcom® extends NSX-V support for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customers into 2025, allowing for this extension to {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} deployments. For more information, see [End of Support for NSX-V instance deployments](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-eos-nsx-v). IBM does not anticipate any further extensions after 28 February 2025.

## What is the next step?
{: #faq-shared-eos-next}
{: faq}

It is recommended that you immediately assess your workloads on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}, and plan the migration to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} at the earliest. For more information about migration options, see [Migrating from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_migration).

## Is the price changing? Will it cost more?
{: #faq-share-eos-price}
{: faq}

While the price remains largely the same between the two platforms, you can benefit from three key changes:
* The pricing for vCPU and RAM is rebalanced to enable more cost-effective scaling of RAM.
* On-demand Base Charge is not applicable in {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}, as it is replaced by the network edge tiers.
* Network edge tiers are added with four available options, such as Efficiency Edge, Medium Edge, Large Edge, and Extra-Large Edge. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} anticipates that most customers require an Efficiency Edge for their virtual data center, which keeps the price flat across the two platforms.

Customers with an average virtual machine (VM) of 4 vCPU, 12 GB of RAM cannot see any difference in their monthly bills after they migrate to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}. However, customers that use a higher ratio of RAM can see a cost benefit while they move migrate {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}. Both scenarios assume that customers require an Efficiency Edge, rather than a larger tier.
{: important}

In addition to these changes, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} also aligns the Veeam Block Storage pricing to the vSAN storage rates to remain consistent with the underlying technology used. As a result, some {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} customers (with heavy Veeam Block Storage usage) can see a net price increase, when they move to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}.

All existing customers will receive an email with these changes.

## How different is {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}?
{: #faq-shared-eos-vmwaas}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} offers several advantages over {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}:
* Better architecture design that is based on the most recent supported software-defined networking platform from VMware NSX-T™ Networking, with upgraded high availability (HA).
* Increased global reach with planned expansion through 2025.
* Single-pane-of-glass management for customers that use both single and multitenant consumption, with a common bill across.
* Optimized compute pricing model to provide better cost economics for scaling of RAM.
* Optional high-performance network edges to support bandwidth-intensive workloads.
* Improved private networking experience by using {{site.data.keyword.tg_full_notm}}.

## Do I have options for self-service migration tools to migrate my VMs?
{: #faq-shared-eos-self-service-migration}
{: faq}

Yes. VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) enables the VMs migration to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}. You can find more details on how to onboard and migrate your VMs to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} in a secure, simple, and cost-effective manner with the help of VCDA. For more information about migration paths, step-by-step guides, and managed migration services options, see [Migrating from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_migration).

## I have complex workloads that require migration support. What migration paths can I explore?
{: #faq-shared-eos-workloads}
{: faq}

Some migrations require redesigning and reestablishing network connections, edge migrations, and extra support. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} offers a range of managed services through IBM Consulting, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Expert Labs, and migration partners, such as PrimaryIO. For more information about migration paths, step-by-step guides, and managed migration services options, see [Migrating from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_migration).

## Do I have promotions or discounts to offset the cost of dual run?
{: #faq-shared-eos-promotions}
{: faq}

Yes. IBM offers migration promotions (VCFaaS-exclusive credits) for existing {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} customers who want to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}. For details about approved promotions that you can take advantage of and start your upgrade or migration, contact your IBM Customer Success Manager or IBM Sales representative. You can also request migration credits by completing [a promo request form](https://forms.monday.com/forms/75adc2e53e58807ee5ac01cfc80d2972){: external}.

## Does {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} offer all the features and capabilities that are available in {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}? If any parity gaps exist, when will they be addressed?
{: #faq-shared-eos-features}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} has nearly identical features and capabilities that are used in {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}, in addition to a few new capabilities and performance improvements.

The key capabilities of both platforms are:
* Private-only connectivity
* IBM Operated Management Plane with 99.99 availability SLA, based on VMware Cloud Director, with API connectivity
* On-demand (hourly), reserved (monthly), 1 and 3-year committed use
* NFS and vSAN storage options
* Self-managed backup to cloud through Veeam
* Migration tool
* High availability: single-zone

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} is actively working on some features, such as:
* Load balancer
* Self-managed disaster recovery that uses Veeam Cloud Connect
* High availability: multizone regional network HA
* High availability: stretched vSAN
* SOC2 and C5 report

If you rely on the roadmap features, contact your IBM Customer Success Manager or IBM Sales representative to understand the custom upgrade paths and migration promotions that are available to you.

Self-managed disaster recovery that uses Zerto is not on the roadmap for 2024.
{: note}

## Does the migration tool also migrate the network configuration?
{: #faq-shared-eos-mig-tool}
{: faq}

No. VCDA does not include any capability to migrate the network configuration.

## If the network configurations are not migrated, would it be advisable to use new subnets to minimize potential issues?
{: #faq-shared-eos-subnets}
{: faq}

You can use new subnets; however most customers don't. If you plan to migrate a subnet in multiple batches, then you need to reassign IP addresses as no L2 extension capability exists.

## What are the recommended steps for an optimal migration?
{: #faq-shared-eos-optimal-mig}
{: faq}

We recommend the following best practices:

1. Provision your {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} instance in the same region as the existing {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} instance.
2. Create your network or networks in {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}: segments, networks, firewall rules, and NAT. For more information, see [Technical considerations about migrating from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared-vmwaas-migration).
3. (Optional) If you are planning to use {{site.data.keyword.tg_full}} to connect to other resources, configure interconnectivity.

   If you are planning to keep the existing subnets, do not advertise these routes through {{site.data.keyword.tg_short}} until the VMs are migrated.
   {: attention}

4. Verify that your workloads are ready to be migrated, that is, you can see the source VMs and destination VDC and networks. For more information, see [Migrating {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} workloads to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} with cloud-to-cloud connections](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-vcda-migrating-cloudtocloud-shared).
5. Set up the replication in advance and plan to perform the migration outside working hours, for example, a weekend evening.

   The workloads are restarted as part of the migration.
   {: note}

6. (Optional) If you are using {{site.data.keyword.tg_short}}, after the workloads are migrated, advertise the appropriate routes.
