{: troubleshoot}



When you add a high availability (HA) cluster configuration with only one file share, the following configuration issue is seen on the VMware ESXi™ hosts:

`The number of heartbeat datastores for host is 1, which is less than required: 2`

This issue occurs if redundancy is not in shared storage to allow for data store heart beating.
