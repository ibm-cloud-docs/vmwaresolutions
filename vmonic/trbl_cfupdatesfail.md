# Updates to Cloud Foundation instances fail when the add ESXi servers operation fails
{: #trbl_cfupdatesfail}

## Problem
{: #trbl_cfupdatesfail-problem}

If you add ESXi servers to a V1.5 or V1.6 VMware Cloud Foundation instance and the add operation fails, the update option is disabled and you cannot apply the V1.5 to V1.6 or the V1.6 to V1.7 update to the instance.

## Resolution
{: #trbl_cfupdatesfail-resolution}

Before you apply the V1.6 update to a V1.5 Cloud Foundation instance, or the V1.7 update to a V1.6 instance, ensure that the add ESXi servers operation was successful.
