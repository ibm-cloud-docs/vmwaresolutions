# Updates to Cloud Foundation instances fail when the add ESXi servers operation fails

## Problem

If you added ESXi servers to a V1.5 or V1.6 VMware Cloud Foundation instance and the add operation failed, the update button is disabled and you are not allowed to apply the V1.5 -> V1.6 or V1.6 -> V1.7 update to the instance.

## Resolution

Before you apply the V1.6 update to a V1.5 Cloud Foundation instance, or the V1.7 update to a V1.6 instance, ensure that the add ESXi servers operation was successful.
