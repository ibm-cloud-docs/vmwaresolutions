# Release notes for V2.8
{: #relnotes_v28}

This release includes new features, component updates, usability enhancements, and bug fixes. For a list of fixed issues in different releases, known issues with the product, and tips to use {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/cloudvmw/){:new_window}.

## Single-node Trial for Migration and App Modernization instances
{: #relnotes_v28-single-node-trial}

The Single-node Trial for Migration and App Modernization is a quick way to test drive {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to migrate VMware workloads into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and then modernize workloads using containers. This trial is a version of {{site.data.keyword.icpfull_notm}} Hosted on VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} that provides the Kubernetes management platform for containers and the single-tenant VMware platform that can be managed using the same familiar tools as on-premises environments.

For more information, see [Single-node Trial for Migration and App Modernization overview](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-single-node-trial-for-migration-and-app-modernization-overview).

## Adding and removing network file system storage
{: #relnotes_v28-nfs}

Starting with the V2.8 release, you can now add network file system (NFS) storage shares to an existing NFS or vSAN vCenter Server cluster, as well as remove NFS file shares from an existing vCenter Server cluster.

The following options for customized shared file-level storage are now available:

* NFS share sizes starting at 20GB up to 12TB at single GB increments
* 0.25 IOPS/GB

For more information, see the *Adding NFS storage to vCenter Server instances* and *Removing NFS storage from vCenter Server instances* sections in [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_addingremovingservers#adding-nfs-storage-to-vcenter-server-instances).

Starting with the V2.8 release, the following new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}} CPU models are available for deployment for VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and VMware vSphere on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instances and clusters:

* Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 processor / 28 cores total, 2.60 GHz / 512 GB RAM
* Quad Intel Xeon E7-8890 v4 processor / 96 cores total, 2.20 GHz / 1024 GB RAM
* Quad Intel Xeon E7-8890 v4 processor / 96 cores total, 2.20 GHz / 2048 GB RAM
* Quad Intel Xeon E7-8890 v4 processor / 96 cores total, 2.20 GHz / 4096 GB RAM

## Broadwell E7-4820 and E7-4850 server support
{: #relnotes_v28-broadwell-e7}

Starting with the V2.8 release, the following new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short_sing}} CPU models are available for deployment for vCenter Server, vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle, Cloud Foundation, and vSphere on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instances and clusters:

* Quad Intel Xeon E7-4820 v4 / 40 cores total, 2.0 GHz
* Quad Intel Xeon E7-4850 v4 / 64 cores total, 2.1 GHz

* [Ordering vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_orderinginstance#bare-metal-server-settings)
* [Ordering new vSphere clusters](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vsphere?topic=vmware-solutions-vs_orderinginstances#bare-metal-server-settings)

## Embedded Platform Services Controller
{: #relnotes_v28-psc}

Starting with the V2.8 release, vCenter Server is deployed with an embedded PSC (Platform Services Controller), that is, vCenter Server, the vCenter Server components, and the PSC are deployed on a single virtual machine. This change applies to all newly deployed vCenter Server, vCenter Server with Hybridity, and NetApp instances.

For instances that are upgraded from an earlier release to V2.8, the PSC is not embedded in vCenter Server. If you want to use embedded PSC, you must convert from external to embedded PSC yourself.

In a multi-site configuration where the primary instance is an upgraded instance for which the PSC was manually converted from external to embedded, any newly deployed V2.8 secondary instances will have embedded PSC.

For more information, see the *vCenter Server architecture* section in [vCenter Server overview](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_vcenterserveroverview#vcenter-server-architecture).

## Updates for add-on services
{: #relnotes_v28-services}

### IBM Spectrum Protect Plus on IBM Cloud
{: #relnotes_v28-spp}

For more information about the new features in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus V10.1.2, see [IBM Spectrum Protect Plus updates](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSNQFQ_10.1.2/spp/r_techchg_spp.html){:new_window}.

### KMIP for VMware on IBM Cloud
{: #relnotes_v28-kmip}

Previously, you could order a Cloud Foundation or vCenter Server instance with the KMIP for VMware on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service included or add the service to an existing Cloud Foundation or vCenter Server instance after initial deployment.

Starting with the V2.8 release, the service is available as a standalone service without being associated to a VMware instance. Each instance of the service can serve one or more Cloud Foundation instances, vCenter Server instances, or vSphere clusters.

For more information, see [KMIP for VMware on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} overview](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services?topic=vmware-solutions-kmip_standalone_considerations).
