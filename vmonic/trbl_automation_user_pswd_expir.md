# Automation user password expiration

## Problem
You may experience failures in operations performed from the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions console due to a VMware automation user password expiring in a VMware Cloud Foundation instance.  

## Resolution
You will see an automation user in the VMware vSphere Web Client. The users, passwords, and policies should not be changed or automated operations that are provided through the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions console might fail.
