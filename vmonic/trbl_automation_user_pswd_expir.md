# Automation user password expiration

## Problem

You might experience failures in operations performed from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console due to a VMware automation user password expiring in a VMware Cloud Foundation instance. This problem is seen with instances V1.9 and earlier.

## Resolution

You will see an automation user in the VMware vSphere Web Client. The users, passwords, and policies should not be changed or automated operations that are provided through the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console might fail.
