# Ports that are used for deployment and Day 2 operations
{: #vmwaresol_ports-deploy-day2ops}

The following table provides information about the ports for deployment and Day 2 operations. For more information about the ports that are used by the add-on services, see [Ports for services](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmwaresol_ports-services).

Review the following information about the ports described in the [table](#vmwaresol_ports-deploy-day2ops-table):

* Windows® Active Directory™ has two options: single Windows Virtual Service Instance (VSI) and two HA-dedicated Windows Server virtual machines (VMs). For single Windows VSI, the VSI is in the primary subnet. For Windows Server VMs, the VMs are in the [infrastructure VMs](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmwaresol_ports-vlans-subnets) subnet.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure services network subnets vary from data center to data center. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IP ranges](/docs/infrastructure-hub?topic=infrastructure-hub-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).
* Some Windows resources in your environment might use classic infrastructure services in Dallas.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint service network includes `166.8.0.0/14`.
* IBM CloudDriver is an ephemeral VSI that is deployed by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation to configure your instance. While IBM CloudDriver is being bootstrapped, it uses an ephemeral primary IP address. However, after bootstrapping, it uses a predictable portable IP address that you can find on your instance details page. For more information, see [IBM CloudDriver](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-design_infrastructuremgmt#design_infrastructuremgmt-cloud-driver).
* Infrastructure VMs refer to the private portable subnet allocated for use by vCenter, NSX manager, the cloud driver
* Depending on your mode of deployment, your Windows Active Directory domain controllers can be VSIs on a primary subnet, or VMs on a portable subnet.
