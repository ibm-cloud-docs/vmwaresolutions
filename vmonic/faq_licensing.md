* For Entrust CloudControl™ and Entrust DataControl®, service licenses are charged per two CPUs. Dual servers require a single license each. Quad servers require two licenses each.
* For VMware HCX™ and VMware Aria® Operations™, service licenses are included as part of the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-classic-short}} license bundle.
* All other services have static service license charges that do not change based on the number of servers in the instance.
