# Deploying an OVF file using the VMware vSphere Web Client

## Resolution

To deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file by using the vSphere Web Client, use the following procedure:
1. Before attempting deployment, you must add the following host information to the `/etc/hosts` file:

   * Host information for Platform Services Controller (PSC)
   * Host information for VMware ESXi server
   * Host information for vCenter
2. Check your `/etc/hosts` file to ensure that this information is successfully added. An example of a hosts file might look like the following list:

    ```javascript
    10.131.9.201  psc-myinstance.myinstance.mydomain.com
    10.131.7.26   host0.myinstance.mydomain.com
    10.131.7.39   host1.myinstance.mydomain.com
    10.131.7.6    host2.myinstance.mydomain.com
    10.131.7.48   host3.myinstance.mydomain.com
    10.131.9.196  vcenter-1.myinstance.mydomain.com
    ```
3. Ensure that you have access to all the necessary VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}. In this example, it would be `10.131.7.xx` and `10.131.9.xxx`.
4. Sign in the VPN for your data center.
5. Click **vCenter** to access the the vSphere Web Client.
6. Right-click on a host and deploy an `.ovf` file.
