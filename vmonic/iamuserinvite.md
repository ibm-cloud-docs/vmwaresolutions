# Inviting users to access services and resources
{: #iamuserinvite}

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} is integrated with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) for collaboration among multiple users. After you sign up for an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and log in to the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you can add users to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. These added users can share the services and resources that are provisioned for the account.

## Before you begin

* Ensure that you are the account owner or that your platform management role for the **VMware Solutions** service is **Administrator**.
* Ensure that you reviewed the user roles and permissions in [Managing user access with Identity and Access Management](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-managing-user-access-with-iam).
