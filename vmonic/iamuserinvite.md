# Inviting users to access services and resources
{: #iamuserinvite}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for VMwareÂ® Solutions is integrated with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) for collaboration among multiple users. After you sign up for an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and log in to the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you can add users to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. These added users can share the services and resources that are provisioned for the account.

## Before you begin
