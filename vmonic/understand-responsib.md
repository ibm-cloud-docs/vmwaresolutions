## Preserving critical configuration
{: #understand-responsib-preserve-config}

Configuration changes can impact the ability to use the VMware Solutions console to view and manage instances. Preserving certain configurations and settings is critical for the VMware Solutions automation to continue to function properly.

You must manage the VMware Solutions components that are created in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account only from the VMware Solutions console. For more information, see:
* [{{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_vcenterserveroverview)
* [Expanding and contracting capacity for Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservers)

If you change your credentials, for example passwords, IBM Support might no longer be able to help you recover lost or forgotten credentials, or to troubleshoot any problems in your environment. For more information, see [Client responsibilities](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_compl_info#vc_compl_info-client-responsibilities).

Changes to VMware ESXi server names or configurations might have a negative impact on managing your instance. For more information, see:
* [Can I change the ESXi server names and IP addresses?](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-faq_esxi#faq_esxi-change-name-ip)
* [Considerations about changing vCenter Server artifacts](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcenter_chg_impact)

In {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}}, every primary instance deploys an Active Directory domain controller. To understand the limitations on changes that you can make and recommendations on integration in your environment, see:
* [VMware Solutions infrastructure domain](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-adds-infra-domain)
* [VMware Solutions workload domain](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-adds-wkld-domain)
