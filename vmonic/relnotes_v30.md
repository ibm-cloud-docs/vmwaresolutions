# Release notes for V3.0
{: #relnotes_v30}

This release includes new features, component updates, usability enhancements, and bug fixes.

## End of Support for VMware Cloud Foundation on IBM Cloud
{: #relnotes_v30-vcf-eos}

In an effort to consolidate our offerings for a better customer experience, the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} platform will no longer offer VMware Cloud Foundation effective May 13, 2020.

Moving forward, all customers will be directed to VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, our flagship VMware Software-Defined Data Center solution on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal servers.

Existing customers who use VMware Cloud Foundation will be assisted to convert to VMware vCenter Server by the end-of-support date of May 13, 2020.

After May 13 2020, management functions for VMware Cloud Foundation instances will no longer be available from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console until the instances have been converted to VMware vCenter Server. Customers who choose not to have their VMware Cloud Foundation instances migrated or converted to VMware vCenter Server can access their instances from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure console.

## Removed support for Broadwell 2-CPU servers
{: #relnotes_v30-broadwell}

Starting with the V3.0 release, Broadwell 2-CPU servers are no longer available for deployment for new vCenter Server, vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle, vCenter Server with NSX-T, and vSphere on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instances and clusters. You can still add servers to existing clusters.

## Network file system operation enhancements
{: #relnotes_v30-nfs}

Starting with the V3.0 release you can simultaneously add or remove NFS storage and ESXi servers to clusters that are in the **Ready to use** state. For example, you can add or remove an ESXi server in a cluster and add or remove NFS storage in another cluster. This applies to all vCenter Server and vCenter Server with NSX-T instances.

## Updates for VMware vCenter Server instances
{: #relnotes_v30-vcs}

This release applies the following upgrades and improvements:

* vSphere ESXi 6.7 Update 1 (build 6.7.0-13004448)
* vSphere ESXi 6.5 Update 2 (build 6.5.0-13004031)
* vCenter Server Appliance 6.7 Update 1b (build 6.7.0-11727113)
* Platform Services Controller 6.7 Update 1b (build 6.7.0-11727113)

The Windows software that is ordered for Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and DNS (Domain Name System) services is upgraded to Windows Server 2016 for both configuration options: the VSIs (Virtual Server Instances) and the two highly-available Windows VMs.

The AD domain functional level remains at 2008 to allow for backward compatibility with any potential secondary instances. If compatibility with earlier (2008) secondary instances is not a consideration in your environment, you can upgrade the domain functional level to a higher version.

### vSAN storage enhancements
{: #relnotes_v30-vcs-vsan}

* When using vSAN storage, the number of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal servers that you can order can now be greater than four. This applies to all vCenter Server, vCenter Server with Hybridity, and vCenter Server with NSX-T instances.
* Starting with the V3.0 release, an M.2 solid-state drive is ordered with your vSAN storage instance. You can order up to 10 capacity disks or a total of 12 capacity disks if you select the **High Performance with Intel Optane** option.
