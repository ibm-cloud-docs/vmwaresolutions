# End of Support for vSphere 6.7 instance deployments
{: #eos-vsphere67}

Broadcom support for all new VMware vSphere® 6.7 deployments ended on 15 October 2022.

For more information about upgrading to vSphere 7, see:
* [Upgrading vCenter Server vSphere software from vSphere 6.5 or 6.7 to 7.0](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_vsphere_70_upgrade)
* [Upgrading VMware vSphere software from vSphere 6.5 or 6.7 to 7.0](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_vsphere_70_upgrade)

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} recommends that you migrate rather than upgrade to vSphere 7. Migration ensures that you are aligned with current and supported hardware, other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} features, and the recommended vSphere 7 NSX–T topology, including the use of VMware vSphere Distributed Switches.

Before you upgrade, IBM recommends that you assess your environments for infrastructure and workload dependencies to ensure that they are supported for the current version.

vSphere 7 introduces the following features:
* HTML5 client
* Support for Intel Cascade Lake EVC level
* Enhanced vSphere Lifecycle Manager (LCM)
* Enhancements to DRS and vMotion
* Security enhancements such as multifactor authentication (MFA), vSphere Trust Authority (vTA), and in–flight encryption for vSAN
