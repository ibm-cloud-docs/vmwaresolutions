* Broadcom® support for VMware vSphere® 6.7 deployments ended on 15 October 2022.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} support for ordering vSphere® 6.5 ended on 10 October 2021. 

You must upgrade to vSphere 7.

vSphere 7 introduces the following features:
* HTML5 client
* Support for Intel Cascade Lake EVC level
* Enhanced vSphere Lifecycle Manager (LCM)
* Enhancements to DRS and vMotion
* Security enhancements such as multifactor authentication (MFA), vSphere Trust Authority (vTA), and in–flight encryption for vSAN

Before you upgrade, you must assess your environments for infrastructure and workload dependencies to ensure that they are supported for the current version.
