# Packaging and pricing for VMware by Broadcom
{: #vmwaresol_packaging-pricing}

{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

Broadcom announced several changes to the packaging and pricing of the VMware® portfolio that are effective on 1 May 2024. Cloud service providers, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, can no longer sell individual VMware software solutions. These solutions are available only as part of VMware Cloud Foundation™, for which Broadcom announced a new pricing structure.

On 1 May 2024, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} changed its {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} portfolio and pricing in response to the VMware portfolio changes.

## Packaging and naming for offerings
{: #vmwaresol_packaging-naming}

Existing VMware Solutions offerings are no longer available as separate components and are replaced by VMware Cloud Foundation. As a VMware Solutions user, you will see these changes in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog and invoices.

The following table shows the changes of the offering names across the VMware Solutions portfolio:

| Current offering | Updated offering |
|:---------------- |:---------------- |
| VMware as a Service | **{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** or **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}** |
| VMware Cloud Foundation | **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc}}** or **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}}** |
| VMware vCenter Server® | **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}}** or **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}}** |
| VMware vSphere® | **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex}}** or **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}}** |
| VMware ESXi™ on Bare Metal for Classic | VMware ESXi on Bare Metal for Classic (no name change) |
