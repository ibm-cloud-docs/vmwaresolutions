# End of Support for NSX-V instance deployments
{: #eos-nsx-v}

VMware® support for all new VMware NSX-V deployments ended on 16 January 2022.

Beginning on 21 June 2022, you can no longer order new VMware vCenter Server® with NSX-V instances.

However, VMware and IBM worked closely to extend the existing NSX–V support until 31 December 2023. This support is exclusive only for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} on NSX–V. No other on–premises or hyper–scaler company has this support benefit. With this support, you have more time to migrate, but IBM advises you to start migration as soon as possible.

This support is only for VMware NSX–V that was purchased through the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console and for Kyndryl bring your own license (BYOL) clients. This support does not cover your own BYOL.

On 21 June 2022, you can no longer provision new vCenter Server with NSX-V instances, but you can add hosts and clusters to your existing NSX–V deployments. IBM strongly recommends that you immediately assess your NSX–V networks and plan a much earlier migration to NSX–T.

You must migrate your vCenter Server with NSX–V instances from NSX–V to NSX–T. For more information, see [NSX-V to NSX-T migration overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-v2t-overview).

For more information about end of life procedures for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure services and Third–Party software products, see [Lifecycle policy for IBM Cloud products](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-prod-life). If you have any questions or need assistance, email clouddigitalsales@us.ibm.com or open a support ticket in the VMware Solutions console.
