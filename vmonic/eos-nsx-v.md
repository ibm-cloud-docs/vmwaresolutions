# End of Support for NSX-V instance deployments
{: #eos-nsx-v}

Broadcom® support for VMware NSX-V deployments ended on 16 January 2022. In addition, extended NSX-V support from {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} (exclusive to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}) ended on January 2025.

If you are still running NSX-V, your existing instance is not supported and also noncompliant with VMware vCloud Usage Meter. You must [migrate from NSX–V to NSX–T](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-v2t-overview) as soon as possible.
