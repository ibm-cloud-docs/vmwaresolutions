# End of Support for KMIP for VMware
{: #eos-kmip}

{{site.data.content.kmip-deprecated-note}}

Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP™) for VMware® support for Key Protect service will end on 17 April 2026 after which the service will no longer be available.

You must plan and start migration to [{{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Key Protect for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}](/docs/key-protect) services.

These new native providers have the following advantages:
- Improved performance because the calls from KMIP to key provider are closer in network distance and no longer cross the service-to-service authorization boundaries.
- Improved visibility and management for the KMIP keys.

To experience an improved performance, you must migrate to {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Key Protect for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} from KMIP for VMware service. For more information about KMIP migration, see [Migrating from KMIP for VMware to IBM Cloud native KMIP providers](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-kmip_migration).

For more information about end of life procedures for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure services and third-party software products, see [Lifecycle policy for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} products](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-prod-life). If you have any questions or need assistance, email to clouddigitalsales@us.ibm.com, or [open a support ticket](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_support) in the VMware Solutions console.
