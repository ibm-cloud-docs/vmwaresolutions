# Release notes for V2.2

This release includes new features, component updates, usability enhancements, and bug fixes. For a list of fixed issues in different releases, known issues with the product, and tips to use {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/cloudvmw/){:new_window}.

## Spectre and Meltdown remediation

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} has released patches from VMware in response to the vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5754).

* CVEID: [CVE-2017-5753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753)
* CVEID: [CVE-2017-5715](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715)
* CVEID: [CVE-2017-5754](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754)

For more information, see [Addressing Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities](../vmonic/trbl_fix_spectre.html).

## IBM CloudDriver virtual machine upgrade

During the V2.2 upgrade process, the IBM CloudDriver virtual machine is redeployed with CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708. In addition, all new provisioned instances include CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708 on the IBM CloudDriver.

**Important:**

* If you are using a backup solution that references the IBM CloudDriver virtual machine, after you upgrade to V2.2, ensure that the backup solution is referencing the new IBM CloudDriver virtual machine.
* Before you upgrade to V2.2, ensure that you replace the Legacy Veeam VSI with the Veeam on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. Legacy Veeam is no longer supported in V2.2 and future releases, therefore the management component backups that are associated with Legacy Veeam are not available for a restore.

For more information about using the Veeam on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service, see the following topics:
* [Components and considerations for Veeam on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](../services/veeam_considerations.html)
* [Managing Veeam on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](../services/managingveeam.html)

## Support for VMware Federal on IBM Cloud

VMware Federal on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides the option to order a base vCenter Server instance in the WDC03 Federal on {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}}. In addition to supporting a subset of vCenter Server instance offerings, VMware Federal on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides US Federal Government agencies with the option to secure deployed VMware vCenter Server instances. Selecting the option to secure the deployed instances removes sensitive information that is stored about the instance and removes the open management connection for ongoing access to the instance for management functions, such as adding and removing hosts and clusters. After you select the secure option, all management functions are unavailable except for a full instance delete.

For important considerations before you secure a VMware Federal instance, see [Securing VMware Federal instances](../vcenter/vc_fed_securinginstance.html).

(Updated on 2 April 2018) You can now expand or contract the capacity of your VMware Federal instance by adding or removing ESXi servers. This option is available only to VMware Federal instances that have not been secured.

For more information, see the following topics:

* [VMware Federal on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} overview](../vcenter/vc_fed_overview.html)
* [Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for VMware Federal instances](../vcenter/fed_addviewdeleteclusters.html)
* [Expanding and contracting capacity for VMware Federal instances](../vcenter/vc_fed_addingremovingservers.html)

## Advanced configuration settings on ESXi servers

For V2.2 or later releases, new instances are ordered with a new set of advanced configuration settings for ESXi servers.
For instances that are upgraded from a previous release to V2.2 or later releases, some settings require rebooting the ESXi servers. Therefore, only a subset of configuration settings is applied automatically.

It is recommended that you change the remaining configuration settings to the new values for consistency across all instances and to allow adequate support for storage expansion. IBM plans to test only with these new settings for all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware Solutions future releases.

For more information, see _Advanced configuration settings for ESXi servers_ in:
* [vCenter Server Bill of Materials](../vcenter/vc_bom.html#advanced-configuration-settings-for-esxi-servers)
* [Cloud Foundation Bill of Materials](../sddc/sd_bom.html#advanced-configuration-settings-for-esxi-servers)

## Support for up to 51 ESXi servers for an initial cluster and up to 59 ESXi servers for additional clusters

For V2.2 and later releases, you can now increase the number of ESXi servers to a maximum of 51 for an initial cluster and up to 59 for additional clusters.

**Important:** For instances deployed in V2.1 or earlier releases, you must enable necessary vSAN support to increase the cluster size beyond 32. For more information about steps to increase the number of ESXi servers, see _How many ESXi servers can I add to a cluster?_ in [FAQ about ESXi servers](../vmonic/faq_esxi.html#how-many-esxi-servers-can-i-add-to-a-cluster-).

## More network configuration options for vCenter Server and Cloud Foundation instances

For vCenter Server and Cloud Foundation instance orders, you can now reuse existing public and private VLANs for your network configuration. When existing VLANs are not available, you can order one new public and two new private VLANs.

For important considerations before you select existing VLANs, see the *Network interface settings* sections in:
* [Ordering vCenter Server instances](../vcenter/vc_orderinginstance.html)
* [Ordering Cloud Foundation instances](../sddc/sd_orderinginstance.html)

## Updates for VMware vCenter Server instances

### NSX component and port group configuration setting updates

The current release applies the VMware NSX for vSphere 6.3.5 component update. For more information about components, see [vCenter Server Bill of Materials](../vcenter/vc_bom.html).

For VMware vCenter Server instances that are deployed in V2.2 or later releases, the NSX and port group configuration settings have changed. For more information, see the *NSX and port group configuration settings* section in [vCenter Server Software Bill of Materials](../vcenter/vc_bom.html#nsx-and-port-group-configuration-settings).

### New option for DNS configuration

You can now select the deployment of a single Microsoft Windows Server Virtual Server Instance (VSI) for Microsoft Active Directory (AD) or two high availability Microsoft Windows virtual machines in the management cluster. For releases before V2.2, the single Microsoft Windows VSI for Microsoft AD was automatically deployed by default. The new option to select two Microsoft Windows virtual machines provides more privacy and the option to backup and restore the virtual machines that use the Veeam service.

**Note:** You must provide 2 Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 licenses if you configure your instance to use the two Microsoft Windows virtual machines. Use the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard edition license and/or the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter edition license. You have 30 days to activate the virtual machines.
