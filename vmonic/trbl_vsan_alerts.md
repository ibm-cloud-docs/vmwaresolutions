# Virtual SAN Health alerts and warnings

## Problem
On the VMware vSphere Web Client **Monitor** page, you might see alerts and warnings that relate to Virtual SAN Health issues.

## Resolution 
These warnings are non-issues and do not indicate functional problems. However, if you want to clear the warnings from the vSphere Web Client, 
use the following procedure.

1. Go to http://partnerweb.vmware.com/service/vsan/all.json and save the JSON file, with the name `all.json`, on your local system.
2. Ensure that you completed the steps in [vCenter console timeout](trbl_timeout_vc_console.html).
3. On the details page of the Cloud Foundation instance, click the **vCenter console** button and log in to the vSphere Web Client using the credentials displayed on the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console.
4. On the vSphere Web Client, go to **Manage > Settings** and open the **Virtual SAN > Health > HCL Database** section. Click **Update from file**, then upload the `all.json` file that you saved previously.
5. To clear the warnings, go to the **Alarms** pane on the upper right of the vSphere Web Client. Right-click each of the alarms and select **Reset to green**.
