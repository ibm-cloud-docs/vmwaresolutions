# IBM user IDs
{: #audit_user_ids}

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} maintains a set of users in your account for use by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation when you run operations such as adding hosts, clusters, or storage to your VMware® instance. Users in your account can also be used for installation and configuration of services by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services automation. Review the following sections for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation user IDs.

VMware instance operations fail if IBM user IDs are deleted, disabled, or if their passwords are changed.
