# Additional limitations and considerations

Review the following considerations and limitations when you work with {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}}.

## Windows automatic installation of updates

The Microsoft Active Directory (AD) / Domain Name Server (DNS) is automatically set up to only download updates. It does not install these updates or reboot automatically. You must install the updates manually and reboot at a scheduled time that avoids any interruptions of the ongoing AD server configuration and other backup jobs. To apply Windows updates, install the updates manually.

## Considerations when choosing a root domain name for Cloud Foundation instances

When choosing a domain name during the deployment of a primary or secondary Cloud Foundation instance, you need to verify that the `sddcmanager.<subdomain>` host name does not resolve to an external domain by using the `ping` or `nslookup` commands.

The structure of the Cloud Foundation instance subdomain is `<VCF instance name>.<domain name>`. For example, if your `<domain name>` is `test.local`, and the Cloud Foundation instance name is `mytest`, then the `sddcmanager.mytest.test.local` host name should not resolve to an IP address before deploying the Cloud Foundation instance. Otherwise, the instance deployment might fail.
