# Zerto Virtual Replication Appliances are not displayed for newly created ESXi servers

## Problem
Virtual Replication Appliances (VRA) are not displayed on the Zerto Virtual Replication console after adding ESXi servers to a VMware vCenter Server instance that has Zerto disaster recovery installed.

## Resolution
For vCenter Server instances, the Zerto disaster recovery service is installed only on the ESXi server from the default cluster, **cluster1**. Any additional clusters in the same vCenter Server environment do not have Zerto disaster recovery installed automatically when the additional cluster is created nor when the ESXi server is added to that additional cluster.

On the additional clusters, you must install Zerto disaster recovery separately.

Open a Bluemix Support ticket and work with IBM Support to obtain available IP addresses for you to install the VRAs from the Zerto console, instead of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console.

To access the Zerto console, click the Zerto card from the **Services** tab of the instance and click **View Details** then, **View Zerto Console**.
