| Storage options | NFS or vSAN™ available with automation. </br>iSCSI available with manual configuration. | NFS, vSAN, or iSCSI available with manual configuration |
| Number of ESXi™ servers in the initial cluster | For vSAN, four servers. </br></br>For NSX-T instances with an NFS cluster:</br>(1) Consolidated NFS clusters require at least three ESXi servers.</br>(2) Management NFS clusters require at least three ESXi servers for production use.</br>(3) All other NFS clusters require at least two ESXi servers.| No limitation. One or more ESXi servers as allowed on the console. For example, you can deploy a three node vSAN cluster with FTT=1. |
| Maximum number of ESXi servers[^servers] | 59 per cluster | 96 per cluster |
| Cloud automated multisite deployment | Supported for new instances | Supported. Automated configuration not included. |
| Add ESXi servers | Supported | Supported. Automated configuration not included. |

[^automation]: According to a validated design and with verification during deployment

[^servers]: For V2.1 or earlier instances, to increase beyond 32 ESXi servers in a vSAN cluster, see [How many ESXi servers can I add to a cluster?](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-faq_esxi#faq_esxi-cluster)

[^nsxv1]: NSX-V only

[^nsxvexist]: NSX-V and existing instances use legacy NSX licensing.

[^nsxv3]: NSX-V only

[^services]: Not all add-on services are supported for NSX-T instances
