{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

Find answers to frequently asked questions about the end of marketing for VMware on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

## What is changing and when are these changes going into effect?
{: #faq-eos-vms-whtchanged}
{: faq}

Effective 31 October 2025, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} will no longer sell VMware on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offerings to customers who do not have at least one active VMware workload that is running on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} before that date.

Existing customers can continue to use and expand their VMware environments, but the following restrictions apply beginning on 31 October 2025:

* Existing customers cannot order a different VMware offering than what they currently use.
* The following restrictions apply only to the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas-full}} offering:
   * Workload expansion is limited to your current regions or resource pools.
   * The consumption model is limited to your existing model: on-demand or reserved.
   * Using the Veeam® Backup service for virtual machine (VM) backup is not available if you are not already using the service to actively back up your VMs.
   * Existing usage of the Veeam Backup service cannot be expanded beyond your current regions.
   * New dedicated Veeam Scale-out Backup Repositories (SOBRs) are limited to Cloud Object Storage (COS) only storage.

*Existing customer* is defined as an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account (or Enterprise child account) with at least one active VMware workload on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} before 31 October 2025. If an existing customer has multiple {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts, only those accounts that have the VMware offerings before 31 October 2025 are allowed to expand their environments based on the restrictions that are stated earlier.

*VMware workload* is defined as:

* At least one deployed host machine on the following {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offerings:
   * VMware on Bare Metal Servers for Classic, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Government environments
   * {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}}
   * {{site.data.keyword.vcf-flex-short}}
   * {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}}
   * {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} single-tenant
* At least one deployed or migrated VM on {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} multitenant

{: note}

## Why is {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} announcing the End of Marketing?
{: #faq-eos-vms-reason}
{: faq}

Due to changes to the Broadcom VCSP (VMware Cloud Services Provider) partner program, {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} is no longer permitted to sell VMware licenses to customers who do not have at least one active VMware workload that is running on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by 31 October 2025.

## Will VMware Cloud Foundation License Portability continue to be available to existing customers?
{: #faq-eos-vms-licensing}
{: faq}

Yes. If you are an existing customer by 31 October 2025, then License Portability is available, if you have valid VMware license keys. The License Portability program is subject to Broadcom’s ability to change their license terms.
