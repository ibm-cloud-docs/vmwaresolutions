## Can I add edge nodes to an NSX Edge Cluster?
{: #vpc-vcf-faq-nsx-edge-nodes}
{: faq}

In {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances, the high availability setting for and Tier 0 Gateway is set as Active-Standby and uses HA VIP. For this reason, the process that is documented in [Add edge nodes to an NSX edge cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.5/vcf-admin/GUID-ED90A614-B670-4E1C-9143-82896F147F74.html){: external} cannot be used.

When you deploy the solution, it is recommended to select a large enough NSX and edge node size.

## Can I deploy more clusters in another zone in my {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} instance?
{: #vpc-vcf-faq-vpc-zones}
{: faq}

Currently, {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances support {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} deployments with a Single Availability Zone. One vCenter Server is deployed to the Management Domain and that vCenter and its ESXi hosts provide the compute capacity to all management components for the SDDC, such as the SDDC Manager, vCenter for the Workload Domain and the NSX Manager clusters for management and workload domains.

## What storage options do I have with my {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instance?
{: #vpc-vcf-faq-storage}
{: faq}

Currently, for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances, all principal and supplemental storage that is deployed as part of automation is vSAN storage only.

## What are the password policies and how do I manage passwords in {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}}?
{: #vpc-vcf-faq-passwords-vcf}
{: faq}

The initial passwords for your {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instance are randomly generated as part of the provisioning and starting procedure.

During initial deployment, the VMware Solutions automation creates an IBM automation account that is named **ibm_admin**, which will be used only to get your updated password. If you changed the initial password, retrieving the updated password is necessary for running Day 2 operations, such as adding or removing hosts.

We don’t recommend you to change the **ibm_admin** password, but if you changed it, you must follow these steps so that you can complete the Day 2 operations successfully:

1. Go to the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instance details page.
2. Click the **Access information** tab and scroll down to the **SDDC Manager** section.
3. Under the **IBM Automation** account, click **Update password** and enter your updated **ibm_admin** password.

For more information about the supported password policies in VMware Cloud Foundation, see [Configuring password complexity policies in VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.5/vcf-operations/GUID-22C6746A-6703-47E5-B17A-313EC959EC62.html){: external}.

You can rotate and update some of these passwords by using the password management functions in the SDDC Manager UI. You can rotate passwords for the following accounts:

* The accounts used for service consoles, such as the ESXi root account.
* The single sign-on administrator account.
* The default administrative user account used by virtual appliances.
* Service accounts that are automatically generated during powering on, host commissioning, and workload creation.

   Service accounts have a limited set of privileges and are created for communication between products. Passwords for service accounts are randomly generated by SDDC Manager. You cannot manually set a password for the service accounts. To update the credentials for service accounts, you can rotate the passwords.

To provide optimal security and proactively prevent any passwords from expiring, rotate passwords every 80 days.

For more information, see:

* [Password management](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.5/vcf-admin/GUID-1D25D0B6-E054-4F49-998C-6D386C800061.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIA5gM6IO4HsBOATABAWzADswBzAUzzMIBcQBfIA){: external}
* [Password policy configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.5/vcf-operations/GUID-18A95158-30F5-460F-AF80-33F25B6533D0.html){: external}

## I have an issue with my {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} passwords, what can I do?
{: #vpc-vcf-faq-passwords}
{: faq}

Passwords are shown on the **Access information** tab. These passwords are the passwords that were randomly generated during the provisioning. If you changed the passwords post initial provisioning and you have password issues, you can use SDDC Manager to get these passwords for the components.

SSH into the SDDC manager by using user `vcf`. You can view the passwords by using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using the `lookup_passwords` command on the SDDC manager virtual machine. You can run the command in the following ways:

   * Run the command: `lookup_passwords -u username@domain -p password -e entityType -n pageNo -s pageSize` providing proper values to arguments.
   * Use `lookup_passwords -h` to view help information, which lists details about each of the arguments. Run the command and enter the value when prompted: `lookup_passwords`

* Using password management SDDC APIs:

   1. Request a bearer token to access the APIs: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "username@domain","password": "password"}' --insecure https://localhost/v1/tokens | json_pp`
   2. Run the lookup API: `curl -X GET -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H  "Authorization: Bearer <token value>"  'localhost/v1/credentials?resourceType=PSC' | json_pp`

## How do I back up and restore {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} components?
{: #vpc-vcf-faq-operations-backups-vcf}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} system backups are configured to use SDDC manager. Backups are configured to use the folder `/nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/backup` on the SDDC manager. You can change this configuration post-deployment to fit your own backup requirements.
