# vSphere console configuration issue seen on adding HA cluster

## Problem
When adding an HA (High Availability) cluster configuration with only one file share, the following configuration issue is seen on the ESXi hosts:

`The number of heartbeat datastores for host is 1, which is less than required: 2`

## Resolution
This issue occurs if there is no redundancy in shared storage to allow for datastore heartbeating. 

For more information and steps how to fix the problem, see [HA error: "The number of heartbeat datastores for host is 1, which is less than required: 2" (2004739)](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2004739)
