# Upgrading Usage Meter
{: #usage_meter-upgrade}

Existing VMware vCloud Usage Meters must be upgraded to version 9 to integrate with their own access token. The upgrade process for Usage Meter with version 4.8 will involve receiving an access token for your currently registered Usage Meter through the IBM Cloud Usage Meter portal, followed by an in-place upgrade to version 9. You will not need to provide the access token for additional upgrades after the initial upgrade to version 9 or later.

4. Enter **y** to confirm that a snapshot is created to the Usage Meter VM.

   An error message about the Usage Meter hostname might appear. Enter **y** to continue the upgrade path. 
   {: note}

5. The upgrade process will start and when it's complete, enter **y** to restart the Usage Meter VM.
6. After the restart is complete, open the Usage Meter URL in a web browser and log in to verify the upgraded version. Then, confirm the health of the Usage Meter appliance.

After you migrate the Usage Meter VM, you might encounter the error "Connection control operation failed for disk" during the upgrade process. This problem might happen due to an active snapshot that retains a lock on the mounted CD/DVD device. To resolve it, complete one of the following procedures. However, you might need to complete all of them for a successful migration of the VM.

1. **Delete any existing snapshots**:
   1. In the VMware vSphere Web Client, log in to your vCenter Server instance as an administrator.
   2. Under the **Hosts and clusters** menu, select the Usage Meter VM.
   3. In the **Snapshots** tab, select **DELETE ALL** or specify any of the snapshots that have the CD/DVD drive mounted and select **DELETE**.
   5. Click **OK**.

2. **Disconnect the mounted drive**:
   1. In the VMware vSphere Web Client, log in to your vCenter Server instance as an administrator.
   2. Under the **Hosts and clusters** menu, locate and right click the Usage Meter VM, and select **Edit settings**.
   3. Clear the box in the CD/DVD drive where you mounted the upgrade ISO file.
   4. Click **OK**.

3. **Disconnect the mounted drive from the hosted ESXi**:
   1. In the VMware vSphere Web Client, log in to your vCenter Server instance as an administrator.
   2. Under the **Hosts and clusters** menu, select the Usage Meter VM.
   3. In the **Summary** tab, locate **Related objects** and determine which host the VM is located.
   4. Log in to the ESXi host as root or an administrator.
   5. Select **Virtual machines** and right click the Usage Meter VM in the list.
   7. Click **Edit settings**.
   8. Under **CD/DVD drive**, clear the **Connected** checkbox.
   9. Click **Save**.

### Replacing the VCF Usage Meter certificate
{: #usage_meter-upgrade-certificate}

If you cannot access the Usage Meter URL or log in and view the dashboard after the upgrade, complete the following steps to replace the VCF Usage Meter certificate due to an incompatible hostname:

1. Use **usagemeter** username for the SSH into the Usage Meter VM.
2. Run the command `stop.sh All` to stop all services.
3. Under a root user, run the command `hostnamectl hostname <new hostname>` to update the hostname with the correct value.
4. Run the commands `export $(grep -v '^#' "/opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/conf/env.properties" | xargs)` and `mv /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/keystore /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/keystore.backup` to export the environment variables and backup the existing keystore.
5. If FIPS is enabled, run the command `keytool -changealias -alias "usage-meter-platform" -destalias "usage-meter-platform-backup" -keystore /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/cacerts -storetype BCFKS -providerclass org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider -providerpath /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/lib/bc-fips-*.jar -storepass "${TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD}"`. If it is disabled, run the command `keytool -changealias -alias "usage-meter-platform" -destalias "usage-meter-platform-backup" -keystore /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/cacerts -storepass "${TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD}"`.
 
   If you run the FIPS disabled version while FIPS is enabled, the error `keytool error: java.security.KeyStoreException: Unrecognized keystore format.` is displayed. To resolve it, load it with a specified type.
   {: note}

6. Create a temporary directory for the NGINX variable and run the command `export NGINX_FOLDER=$(mktemp -d)` to move it into the **cloudusagemetering** directory, then run `cd /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering` to access the new directory.
7. Run the command `./platform/bin/create-keystore.sh` to create the new keystore.
8. Run the commands `rm -rf $NGINX_FOLDER` and `rm /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/keystore.backup` to remove the temporary backup files.
9. If FIPS is enabled, run the command `keytool -delete -alias "usage-meter-platform-backup" -keystore /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/cacerts -storetype BCFKS -providerclass org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider -providerpath /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/lib/bc-fips-*.jar -storepass "${TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD}"` to delete the backup keystore. If it is disabled, run the command `keytool -delete -alias "usage-meter-platform-backup" -keystore /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/cacerts -storepass "${TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD}"`.
10. Run the command `chmod 0640 /opt/vmware/cloudusagemetering/platform/security/keystore` to update the new keystore permissions and restart the Usage Meter VM.

    Due to the hostname change, you might need to update your DNS entry to the new hostname or add it if it doesn't exist. When you attempt to log in and you are redirected with an OAuth error to the login page, clear any existing DNS entries for the Usage Meter and try to log in again.
    {: note}

11. After the restart is complete, open the Usage Meter URL in a web browser to verify the upgraded version.
