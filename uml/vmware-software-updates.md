To update VMware software, you can open a support ticket to access software downloads or to perform automated downloads and updates.

## Downloading VMware software
{: #downloading-vmware-software}



To download VMware software, [open a support ticket](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_support) in the VMware Solutions console. 
You can either:
* Request to access the software downloads to which you are entitled, or
* If you want to use a tool such as vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM) to perform automated downloads and updates, request the required BroadcomÂ® download token from {{site.data.keyword.IBM}}. For more information about how to apply this token to multiple products, see [VCF authenticated downloads configuration update instructions](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/390098){: external}.
