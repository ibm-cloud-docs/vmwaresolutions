# Ordering virtual data centers
{: #shared_ordering}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for VMware速 Solutions Shared offers either a standardized or customizable deployment option of VMware速 virtual data center environments. Choose the **On-demand** or **Reserved** option.

## Requirements for virtual data centers
{: #shared_ordering-reqs}

If you are ordering a virtual data center for the first time, ensure that you completed the tasks in the **Before you begin** section on the ordering page. For more information, see [Setting up your environment for your first order](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-completing_checklist).

## System settings
{: #shared_ordering-sys-settings}

You must specify the following system settings when you order a VMware Solutions Shared virtual data center.

### Pricing plans
{: #shared_ordering-pricing}

The pricing plan is based on your selection of **On-demand** or **Reserved**.

#### On-demand
{: #shared_ordering-pricing-on-demand}

For the on-demand offering, virtual data center virtual CPU (vCPU) and RAM are allocated as needed. The amount of time that the allocation takes depends on global usage of the virtual data center vCPU and RAM.

* The limits that are established for the amount of vCPU and RAM are maximum values that can be used at any time.
* vCPU and RAM resources can be increased and decreased later as required.
* The price is calculated hourly and it is based on the resource usage in the virtual data center.
* The amount of storage that can be allocated and used in the virtual data center is limited to 200 TB for each storage policy. Charges are hourly based on GB of allocated storage.
* The amount of inbound and outbound public networking is unlimited. Public outbound bandwidth is charged per GB.

#### Reserved
{: #shared_ordering-pricing-reserved}

For the Reserved offering, the vCPU and RAM virtual data center reservations are pre-allocated and their availability is guaranteed.

* The price is calculated monthly for the full reservation and it is based on the allocation size of the virtual data center.
* vCPU and RAM resources can be increased and decreased later as required.
* The amount of storage that can be allocated and used in the virtual data center is unlimited. Charges are hourly based on GB of allocated storage.
* The amount of inbound and outbound public networking is unlimited. Public outbound bandwidth is charged per GB.

For more information, see [VMware Solutions Shared pricing](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_pricing).

### Virtual data center name
{: #shared_ordering-inst-name}

The virtual data center name is set to **vdc-_xx_** by default, where _xx_ represents two randomly generated alphabetic characters.

You can also specify a virtual data center name that meets the following requirements:
* The maximum length is 128 characters.
* Only alphanumeric, dash (-), and underscore (_) characters are allowed.
* The name must be unique within all active virtual data centers in your account. You can create a virtual data center that has the same name as a previously deleted virtual data center.

### Resource group
{: #shared_ordering-resource-group}

Use resource groups to organize the resources in your account for access control and billing purposes. The default resource group in your account is selected by default. You can also select another resource group according to your needs. The resource group that you select cannot be changed after the virtual data center is created.

If **No resource group available** is displayed in this field, you currently do not have the permission to add the virtual data center to any resource group in this account. Contact the account owner to be assigned an Editor or Administrator role on a resource group in the account. For more information, see [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).

## Deployment topology
{: #shared_ordering-deploytop}

Select **Single-zone VMware virtual data center** to deploy your virtual data center in a single-zone data center. The multizone deployment is not supported at this time for users who are not Business Partners.

## Data center location
{: #shared_ordering-dc}

Select the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center where the virtual data center is to be hosted.

## Networking
{: #shared_ordering-networking}

You must specify the following network settings for your virtual data center.

### Networking type
{: #shared_ordering-networking-type}

Select either **Private only** or **Secure public and private**. Public networking is delivered through a generic routing encapsulation enablement tunnel system.

## Virtual data center capacity
{: #shared_ordering-cpu}

Virtual data center capacity is based on your selection of the **On-demand** or **Reserved** pricing plan.

If you selected **On-demand**, select the vCPU and RAM limits.

If you selected **Reserved**, your vCPU model settings are based on your selection of **Preconfigured** or **Customizable**.

If you selected **Preconfigured**, you have the following options for allocated vCPU and RAM limits.

| Size    | vCPU      | RAM      |
|:------- |:-------- |:------ |
| Small | 64 cores | 512 GB |
| Medium | 128 cores | 1024 GB |
| Large | 256 cores | 2048 GB |
{: caption="Table 1. Preconfigured vCPU and RAM options" caption-side="top"}

If you selected **Customizable**, you can customize your reserved vCPU and RAM limits.

The vCPU maximum number is limited to the 40 cores with hyperthreading on each host. This limit allows for a maximum of 80 vCPU virtual machines.
