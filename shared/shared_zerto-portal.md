# Accessing the Zerto Self-Service Portal
{: #shared_zerto-portal}

The Zerto service is available and ready-to-use in all virtual data centers. Use Zerto as a service to replicate your VMs between your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}Â data centers to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The Zerto service is enabled by default.

You can access the Zerto portal on the virtual data center details page when the virtual data center is in the **Ready to use** state. For more information, see [Procedure to view the virtual data center summary](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_viewing-vdc-summary#shared_viewing-vdc-summary-procedure) or [Procedure to view virtual data center details](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_viewing-vdc-details#shared_viewing-vdc-details-procedure).

Service charges are incurred only if you choose to use the services.

## Before you begin
{: #shared_zerto-portal-prereq}

- Review the following limitations for Zerto:
   - The current version of Zerto is v8.5 u2 and is only compatible with the N-1 and N+1 level of Zerto on your on-premises site.
   - Currently, Zerto does not support the replication of stand-alone VMs but only vApps with VMs inside them. IBM is working with Zerto to resolve this limitation.
- You must reset the zOrg administrator password before you can log in to the Zerto portal.

## Procedure to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal from the virtual data center
{: #shared_zerto-portal-procedure}

1. Under **Recommended services** on the virtual data center details page, click **Reset ZORG password**.
2. In the **Reset ZORG password** window, click **Reset password**.
3. Click **Zerto portal** and login to the self-service portal.

After you reset your password on a virtual data center, you have access to the Zerto portal from all virtual data centers in your account. You can now manage VMs across all of your virtual data centers.
