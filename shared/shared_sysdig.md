# Visualizing your virtual data center instance environment with IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig
{: #shared_sysdig}

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} Shared provides an integration with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Monitoring for Sysdig, which allows you to use a VMwareÂ® Solutions Shared provided default dashboard to view metrics for your virtual data centers. Alternatively, you can create your own dashboard to visualize performance, volume of usage, and to define alerts to monitor your environment.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Monitoring for Sysdig dashboards allows you to:

* Explore and easily visualize your environment.
* Accelerate a diagnosis and a resolution for performance incidents.
* Control cost of monitoring infrastructure.
* Mitigate impact of abnormal situations with proactive notifications.
