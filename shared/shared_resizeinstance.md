# Resizing virtual data center instances
{: #shared_resize}

You can change the amount of resources that are assigned to a virtual data center when a virtual data center instance is in the **Ready To Use** state.

## Procedure to resize virtual data center instances
{: #shared_resize-procedure}

1. From the VMwareÂ® Solutions Shared virtual data center instance details page, click the pencil icon next to **Resource Reservation**.
2. Update the values of the virtual CPU (vCPU) or RAM properties.
3. Click the **Optional consumption-based charges** section to expand it. Verify the configuration and estimated price and place the order by clicking the **Modify** button.

The configuration change might fail if the vCPU and RAM resources are in use while they are reduced. This happens because the virtual data center resources cannot be reduced to a level lower than the currently active resource usage.
{:note}

The virtual data center instance enters in the **Modifying** state while the change is being made. When the resources are ready to use, the status is changed to **Ready to use**.
