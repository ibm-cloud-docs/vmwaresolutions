# Visualizing your virtual data center environment with IBM Cloud Monitoring
{: #shared-monitor}

* Explore and easily visualize your environment.
* Accelerate a diagnosis and a resolution for performance incidents.
* Control cost of monitoring infrastructure.
* Mitigate impact of abnormal situations with proactive notifications.
