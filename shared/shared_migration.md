# Migrating from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}
{: #shared_migration}

{{site.data.content.shared-deprecated-note}}

## Migration options
{: #shared_migration-options}

You can migrate your workloads from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas-full}}. Since {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} is based on VMware Cloud Director, it retains the same console that is used for {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}}. You also benefit from performance improvements, options of network edge tier, greater global coverage, and a small price rebalancing, which make {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} the ideal landing zone for your workloads.

As of 4 March 2025, all customer VMs are powered off and are scheduled for deletion on 6 April 2025. All backups, regardless of retention period, are also scheduled to be deleted in April.

Depending on the size and complexity of your workloads, you can migrate them by using a self-service migration tool. If you need assistance, you can choose a partner to help with some migration activities or ask them to do a full migration for you.

You can use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) to migrate your workloads. A supporting video can guide you through the technical aspects of using the tool. After migration, you might have other workloads on the cloud or on-premises to migrate. The VCDA tool can do a full migration for you. However, you are not charged for using VCDA to migrate your workloads from {{site.data.keyword.vm-shared}} to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}.

### Considerations about your environment
{: #shared_migration-environment}

Complete the following steps:
* Gather information about your hosts and virtual machines (VMs), their size, and relationships.
* Note any network components that are specific to you.
* Review the [technical considerations about migrating](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared-vmwaas-migration).

### Considerations about your target architecture
{: #shared_migration-target-architecture}

Answer the following questions:
* Are all your hosts and VMs ready to be migrated as-is without changes?
* Do you need to migrate VMs and hosts?
* Is it better to do some consolidation during this process?
* Do you need to update your network configuration?

### Considerations about your migration skills
{: #shared_migration-skills}

* Review the VCDA documentation in [VMware Cloud Director Availability for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} overview](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-tenant-vcda).
* Review the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} setup guide on how to get started on your target environment in [{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} overview](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-vmware-aas-overview).
* Review the options with your technical team.

You can choose to migrate your workloads on your own or get assistance from a partner to migrate either partially or fully.
