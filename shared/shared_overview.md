# Overview of IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared
{: #shared_overview}

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} Shared is provided as an experimental offering and is intended for IBM users only.
{:note}

By using the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared offering, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to the following conditions:
* Only IBM users will have access to the ordered instances.
* No licenses will be used with Windows catalog images.
* No Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines will be added to the environment.

With VMware Virtual Data Centers, you can quickly and seamlessly migrate or deploy VMware workloads to the cloud on top of your professionally-managed VMware infrastructure. IBM provides a self-service on-demand VMware cloud computing platform with vCloud Director running on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. This infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) pay-as-you-go offering allows users to consume specific vCPU, storage, vRAM, Network, and IP, as needed.

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} has three "infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) subscription service types:
- Multi-tenant Reserved Virtual Data Center
- Multi-tenant Pay-as-you-go Virtual Data Center

Customers manage the lifecycle of virtual data centers by using the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} offering. The following functions are supported, either by the web UI or public API:
- Virtual Data Center Creation
- Virtual Data Center Elasticity
- Virtual Data Center Deletion

All three {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Data Center offerings come standard with five public IP addresses on an NSX Edge Service Gateway with unlimited ingress over the public network.

Virtual data centers incur charges for the following components:
- Storage allocations with tiered pricing based on storage performance
- Virtual CPU usage
- Virtual Memory Usage
- Egress on Public Networking
- Commercial operating system licenses used
- Optional VMware services

## IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared architecture
{: #shared_overview-archi}

The following graphic depicts the high-level architecture and components of {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} Shared deployment.

![{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} Shared architecture](../images/vclouddirector-architecture-public.svg "{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} Shared architecture"){: caption="Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} Shared architecture" caption-side="bottom"}

### VMware vCloud Director
{: #shared_overview-vcloud-dir}

This layer represents the management interface. VMwareÂ® vCloud Director provides role-based access to a web-based tenant portal that allows the members of an organization to interact with the organization's resources to create and work with vApps and virtual machines (VMs).

### Organization
{: #shared_overview-org}

An organization is a unit of administration for a collection of users, groups, and computing resources. Users authenticate at the organization level, supplying credentials established by an organization administrator when the user was created or imported. Organization administrators manage organization users, groups, and catalogs.

### Users and policies
{: #shared_overview-users-policies}

An organization can contain an arbitrary number of users and groups. Users can be created locally by the organization administrator or imported from a directory service such as LDAP. Permissions within an organization are controlled through the assignment of rights and roles to users and groups.

### Catalogs
{: #shared_overview-cat}

Organizations use catalogs to store vApp templates and media files. The members of an organization that have access to a catalog can use the catalog's vApp templates and media files to create their own vApps. Organizations administrators can copy items from public catalogs to their organization catalog.

### Virtual data centers
{: #shared_overview-vc}

An organization virtual data center provides resources to an organization. Virtual data centers provide an environment where virtual systems can be stored, deployed, and operated. They also provide storage for virtual CD and DVD media. An organization can have multiple virtual data centers.

## Technical specifications for IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared
{: #shared_overview-specs}

The following components are included in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}:

### Compute
{: #shared_overview-specs-comp}

Compute processing is allocated to virtual data centers in virtual CPU (vCPU) increments. Each vCPU increment represents a single 2.0 GHz core. Compute memory is allocated in GB increments.

### Networking
{: #shared_overview-specs-net}

By default, every virtual data center comes configured with one edge gateway with five public IP addresses and one private service IP address. The edge gateway is customer configurable and can be customized.

The public addresses can be used for public facing vApps for inbound or outbound public internet traffic.

The service address can be used for access to IBM Cloud infrastructure services on the IBM Cloud internal private network, including the following services:
- NTP
- Windows OS licensing and updates
- Red Hat OS licensing and updates
- Cloud Object Storage

### Storage
{: #shared_overview-specs-storage}

When you create or deploy vApps or VMs, a storage policy is selected. There are four different tiers of storage available, depending on the storage performance required:

- NFS Platinum: The storage tier with a maximum throughput of 10 IOPS/GB, the highest performance
- NFS Gold: Storage tier with a maximum throughput of 4 IOPS/GB
- NFS Silver: Storage tier with a maximum throughput of 2 IOPS/GB
- NFS Bronze: Storage tier with a maximum throughput of 0.25 IOPS/GB
