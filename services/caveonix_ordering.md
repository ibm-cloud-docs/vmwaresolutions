# Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight on IBM Cloud
{: #caveonix_ordering}

You can order the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service when you order a new VMware vCenter Server instance with the service included or by adding the service to your existing instance.

## Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight on IBM Cloud for a new instance
{: #caveonix_ordering-new}

To order a new VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance with Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, select **Caveonix RiskForesight on IBM Cloud** in the **Services** section when you order the instance from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.

## Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight on IBM Cloud for an existing instance
{: #caveonix_ordering-existing}

To add the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service into an existing VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance, view the instance that you want to add the service for, click **Services** on the left navigation pane, and then click **Add**.

## Caveonix RiskForesight on IBM Cloud configuration
{: #caveonix_ordering-config}

When you order the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service, provide the following settings.

### License Name
{: #caveonix_ordering-config-license-name}

Specify a unique name for the license.

### License Notes

After you order the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service, if you want more VMs licensed than you specified in the order, you can replace your Caveonix RiskForesight license by ordering a larger license, copying the license to your Caveonix RiskForesight console, and then deleting the previous license from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
