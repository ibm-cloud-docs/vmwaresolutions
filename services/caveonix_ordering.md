# Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight
{: #caveonix_ordering}

You can include the Caveonix RiskForesight™ service with a new VMware vCenter Server® instance or add the service to your existing vCenter Server instance. On these standard vCenter Servers instances, Caveonix RiskForesight generates a license for the number of VMs that you select.

On VMware® Regulated Workloads and VMware Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances, Caveonix RiskForesight offers per host licensing. You are charged for every host on the instance, which includes management, workload, and edge services clusters.

## Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight for a new instance

When you [order the instance](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_orderinginstance-procedure), scroll down to the Add-on services section. Caveonix RiskForesight is in the Recommended services category and is already selected.

Select **Edit** to review and specify the information. If you enter or change information, click **Save**.

If you do not want to order Caveonix RiskForesight, toggle its switch off.
