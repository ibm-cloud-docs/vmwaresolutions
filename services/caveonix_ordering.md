# Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight
{: #caveonix_ordering}

You can order the Caveonix RiskForesight service when you order a new VMware vCenter Server instance or you can add the service to your existing instance.

## Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight for a new instance
{: #caveonix_ordering-new}

When you [order the instance](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_orderinginstance#vc_orderinginstance-procedure), scroll down to the **Optional Services** section and click **Caveonix RiskForesight** in the **Security and Compliance** category. Follow the steps to add the service to your instance.

## Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight for an existing instance
{: #caveonix_ordering-existing}

On the [instance details page](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_viewinginstances), click **Services** on the left navigation pane, click **Caveonix RiskForesight** in the **Security and Compliance** category, and then click **Add**. Follow the steps to add the service to your instance.

## Caveonix RiskForesight configuration
{: #caveonix_ordering-config}

When you order the Caveonix RiskForesight service, provide the following settings.

### License Name
{: #caveonix_ordering-config-license-name}

Specify a unique name for the license.

### License Notes
{: #caveonix_ordering-config-license-notes}

Enter the notes for the service instance. You can edit the notes later on the license details page.

### Number of VMs to License
{: #caveonix_ordering-config-vms}

Select the number of VMs to license. You can order 10 to a maximum of 1,000 VM licenses in increments of 10 licenses. At least 10 VMs are required for license management.

After you order the Caveonix RiskForesight service, if you want more VMs licensed than you specified in the order, you can replace your Caveonix RiskForesight license by ordering a larger license, copying the license to your Caveonix RiskForesight console, and then deleting the previous license from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console.
