# Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight
{: #caveonix_ordering}

You can include the Caveonix RiskForesight™ service with a new {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instance, or add the service to your existing instance.

* For {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instances, Caveonix RiskForesight generates a license for the number of VMs (virtual machines) that you select.
* For {{site.data.keyword.rw}} and Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances, Caveonix RiskForesight offers per-host licensing. You are charged for every host in the instance, which includes management, workload, and gateway clusters.
