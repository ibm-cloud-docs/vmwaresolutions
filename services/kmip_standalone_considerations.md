# KMIP for VMware overview
{: #kmip_standalone_considerations}

The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP™) for VMware® service provides a 24x7 highly available service to manage encryption keys that are used by VMware in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. This service offers runtime capability to allow customers to create, retrieve, activate, revoke, and destroy the encryption keys. It also provides management capability to maintain the associations between the client credentials and the encryption keys.
{: shortdesc}

The KMIP for VMware service is available as a stand-alone service without being associated to a VMware instance. Each instance of the service can serve one or more VMware vCenter Server® instances or VMware vSphere® clusters.

## Technical specifications for KMIP for VMware
{: #technical-specifications-for-kmip-for-vmware-on-ibm-cloud}

For more information about resource requirements and planning for KMIP for VMware, see [Planning for KMIP for VMware](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-kmip-implementation#kmip-implementation-planning).

The following specifications are included with the KMIP for VMware service:

* A VMware-compatible KMIP
* Two managed services - [Key Protect](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/key-protect) and [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/hyper-protect-crypto-services)
* Available in multiple geographic regions worldwide
* Highly available KMIP network service endpoints provided in each region

## Considerations when you install KMIP for VMware instances
{: #kmip_standalone_considerations-install}

Review the following considerations before you install a KMIP for VMware instance:

* KMIP for VMware uses the IBM Key Protect service or the Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS) service to create, encrypt, and decrypt encryption keys. Therefore, before you install KMIP for VMware, ensure that you review the following considerations.
   * You ordered a usable Key Protect or HPCS service instance in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region where your KMIP for VMware instance is to be hosted:
      * For more information about creating an instance of Key Protect, see [Provisioning the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision).
      * For more information about creating an instance of HPCS, see [Provisioning the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-provision#provision). In addition to provisioning the HPCS service, you must also [initialize your crypto instance](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm#initialize-hsm) so that HPCS can provide key related functions.
   * Ensure the following requirements if you are using Key Protect.
      * You created an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service ID by following the steps in [Creating a service ID](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids). This service ID is used to access the Key Protect instance that you created.
      * You granted the following access levels for the service ID:
        * At the platform access level - Viewer authority to your Key Protect or HPCS service instance.
        * At the service access level - Manager authority to your Key Protect or HPCS service instance.
      * You have an API key for the created service ID. The key is required when you order the service.
   * You imported or created at least one customer root key (CRK) by using the GUI or API of Key Protect or HPCS.
      * For more information about importing root keys with the Key Protect GUI or API, see [Importing root keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-import-root-keys) and [Creating import tokens](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-import-tokens), or [IBM Key Protect API](/apidocs/key-protect).
      * For more information about importing root keys with the HPCS GUI or API, see [Importing root keys](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-import-root-keys) and [Creating import tokens](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-import-tokens), or [IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services API](/apidocs/hs-crypto).
      * For more information about creating root keys by using the Key Protect GUI or API, see [Creating root keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-root-keys) or [IBM Key Protect API](/apidocs/key-protect).
      * For more information about creating root keys by using the HPCS GUI or API, see [Creating root keys](/docs/hs-crypto/get-started?topic=hs-crypto-create-root-keys) or [IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services API](/apidocs/hs-crypto).
* Ensure that your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account is enabled for Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) and for connectivity to service endpoints. For more information, see the following topics.
   * [Virtual Routing and Forwarding on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud)
   * [Enabling service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#service-endpoint)
* Only private connection is supported. As a result, you don't need to configure firewall or SNAT rules in vCenter Server for the network connectivity from the vCenter Server to the endpoint of the KMIP for VMware instance.
