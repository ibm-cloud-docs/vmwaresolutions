# Managing VMware HCX on IBM Cloud

## Accessing the HCX on IBM Cloud management consoles

To manage the HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service, you must access the HCX Cloud Console or the HCX Manager Admin Console:
1. Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure VPN or a jump server to allow access to the IP address of the HCX Manager virtual appliance (HCX Manager). You can find the IP address on the HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service details page in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
2. To access the HCX Cloud Console, click **View HCX Cloud Console** on the HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service details page, and then log in by using the vCenter Server credentials.
3. To access the HCX Manager Admin Console, click **View HCX Manager Admin Console** on the HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service details page, and then log in by using the HCX Manager credentials listed on the same service details page.
