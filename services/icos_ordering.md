# Ordering and configuring IBM Cloud Object Storage with Veeam
{: #icos_ordering}

With the release of Veeam Availability Suite 9.5 Update 4, Veeam is compatible with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Object Storage (ICOS).Â The ordering of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage is not automated when you order Veeam, but it can be added after deployment.

To order {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage, complete the following tasks in the specified order.

## Creating an Object Storage instance
{: #icos_ordering-obj}

To create an Object Storage instance, see [Creating a new service instance](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-provision#provision-instance). Follow the steps and return to this section to continue with the following tasks.

## Creating a bucket
{: #icos_ordering-bucket}

To create a bucket, see [Create some buckets to store your data](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started#gs-create-buckets). Follow the steps and return to this section to continue with the following tasks.

## Creating service credentials
{: #icos_ordering-service-cred}

To create service credentials, including HMAC credentials, see [Service credentials](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials#using-hmac-credentials). Follow the steps and return to this section to continue with the following tasks.

## Adding a scale-out repository
{: #icos_ordering-scale-repo}

* As part of the Veeam service installation and configuration, a scale-out backup repository with the name `IC4V Scale-Out Repository` is created. `IC4V Default VM Backup Repository` is added to the scale-out repository as an extent.
* When you create the backup job, you must select `IC4V Scale-Out Repository` as the backup repository, and not `IC4V Default Config Backup Repository`. The latter repository is intended for the Veeam configuration backups.
* You can add more repositories to this default repository, such as a backup repository of type Object Storage. For more information, see [Adding scale-Out repositories](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/sobr_add.html?ver=95u4){:external}. Follow the steps and return to this section to continue with the following tasks.

## Maintaining and managing your cloud tier
