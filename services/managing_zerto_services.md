The Zerto service provides replication and disaster recovery capabilities. These capabilities can be integrated into the deployment offerings to protect and recover data in your VMwareÂ® virtual environment on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.

When you request Managed Disaster Recovery Services by Kyndryl, a fully managed disaster recovery (DR) environment can be deployed by using both Zerto DR software and IBM Resiliency Services.
