# Requesting managed services for Zerto on IBM Cloud
{: #managing_zerto_services}

The Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service provides replication and disaster recovery capabilities. These capabilities can be integrated into the deployment offerings to protect and recover data in your VMware virtual environment on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

When you request managed services for Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, a fully managed disaster recovery (DR) environment can be deployed by using both Zerto DR software and IBM Resiliency Services.

The following models for managed services for Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} are available.

## IBM Orchestrated Managed Services for Zerto
{: #managing_zerto_services-orchestrated}

This model is suitable if you're using the Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offering.

In this model, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resiliency Orchestration service is provisioned for Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. This model can continuously protect the virtual machines, operating systems, and data on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, with uninterrupted DR testing, RTO/RPO (Recovery Time Objective/Recovery Point Objective) visibility, fail-over and fail-back capability.

All functions are managed via the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resiliency Orchestration dashboard by IBM Resiliency Services Global Command Center.

For more information, see [IBM Resiliency Orchestration](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/disaster-recovery-orchestration).

## IBM Managed Services for Zerto (without Orchestration)
{: #managing_zerto_services-without-orchestrated}

In this model, a fully managed DR solution is provisioned for Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. This model is suitable if you want a managed service for Zerto Virtual Replication only, without the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resiliency Orchestration service on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

For more information, see [IBM Resiliency Disaster Recovery as a Service](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/disaster-recovery-as-a-service#product-header-top).
