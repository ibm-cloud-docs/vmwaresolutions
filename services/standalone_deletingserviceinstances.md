# Deleting on-premises HCX instances
{: #standalone_deletingserviceinstances}

Use this procedure to delete the VMware® HCX™ instances that you ordered for on-premises use.

## Considerations before you delete on-premises HCX instances
{: #standalone_considerations-delete}

Review the following considerations before you delete an HCX instance that was ordered for on-premises use:
1. In the VMware vSphere Web Client, go to the HCX user interface and check the following items:
    1. Ensure that no HCX migration or disaster recovery operation is running.
    2. Ensure that all the extended networks are removed.
    3. Ensure that all the interconnect components with paired cloud sites are removed.

   You must complete all the previous steps before you proceed to the next step. Otherwise, the activation key for the on-premises HCX instance is canceled. If the activation key is canceled, migrations can't be performed and errors might occur for HCX components.

3. In the VMware vSphere Web Client, delete the on-premises HCX Manager.
