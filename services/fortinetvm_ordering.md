# Ordering FortiGate Virtual Appliance
{: #fortinetvm_ordering}

You can include the FortiGate® Virtual Appliance service with a new VMware vCenter Server® instance or add the service to your existing vCenter Server instance.

You can deploy the service on a single-zone or multizone instance. For multizone instances, three FortiGate Virtual Appliances are installed, one for each of the three edge gateway clusters.

## Ordering FortiGate Virtual Appliance for a new instance
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-new}

1. When you [order the instance](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_orderinginstance-procedure), scroll down to the Add-on services section. FortiGate Virtual Appliance is in the Security and compliance category. 
2. Open the category, locate FortiGate Virtual Appliance, and toggle its switch on.
3. Select **Edit** to review and specify the information. 
4. If you enter or change information, click **Save**.

You cannot install Juniper® vSRX and FortiGate Virtual Appliance on the same edge gateway cluster.

## Ordering FortiGate Virtual Appliance for an existing instance
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-existing}

1. On the instance details page, click the **Services** tab.
2. Click **Add** to add the service.
3. On the **Services** page, locate the **FortiGate Virtual Appliance** service and toggle its switch on.
4. Follow the steps to configure and add the service to your instance.

## Ordering FortiGate Virtual Appliance for private instances
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-private}

When you order FortiGate Virtual Appliance for instances that are not configured with public interfaces, you must provide a proxy server to complete the installation. The HTTP proxy server must be configured and available through Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) before the FortiGate Virtual Appliance installation can start.

To ensure continued operation, FortiGate Virtual Appliance must have persistent access to the FortiGate license server through the internet. The virtual appliance can access any of the following hostnames:

* update.fortiguard.net
* service.fortiguard.net
* support.fortinet.com
* guard.fortinet.com

## FortiGate Virtual Appliance service configuration
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-config}

When you order the service, provide the following settings.

### Name
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-config-name}

Enter the service name.

### FortiGuard network connection
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-config-network-connect}

Select **Public network** or **Private network** for FortiGuard. If the target cluster is configured with private-only network interfaces or the deployment is for a multizone instance, only the **Private network** option is available. This selection determines how FortiGuard contacts the Fortinet license server to activate the license and to download security patches, and it doesn't impact the workload data plane.

If you select **Private network**, specify the following settings:
* **Proxy IP address** - The IPv4 address of the proxy server.
* **Proxy port number** - The port number of the proxy server, usually 8080 or 3128.
* **Proxy user name** - If you require proxy authentication, enter the username of the proxy server.
* **Proxy password** - If you require proxy authentication, enter the password of the proxy server.

### Deployment size
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-config-size}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} provides the following deployment size options. For deployment on a multizone instance, only FortiGate-VM16 and FortiGate-VM32 are available.
* FortiGate-VM02 (2 vCPUs)
* FortiGate-VM04 (4 vCPUs)
* FortiGate-VM08 (8 vCPUs)
* FortiGate-VM16 (16 vCPUs)
* FortiGate-VM32 (32 vCPUs)
   The FortiGate-VM32 deployment size requires Cascade Lake 5218 or higher.

### Monthly subscription license model
{: #fortinetvm_ordering-config-license}

The monthly subscription license model for FortiGate Virtual Appliance offers the following options:
* **Standard FW** - This bundle includes the following.
   * Stateful packet inspection
   * VLAN protection and advanced logging
