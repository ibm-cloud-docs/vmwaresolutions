# Ordering vRealize Operations and Log Insight
{: #vrops_ordering}

You can order the vRealize Operations and Log Insight service when you order a new VMware vCenter Server instance with the service included or by adding the service to your existing instance.

## Ordering vRealize Operations and Log Insight for a new instance
{: #vrops_ordering-new}

When you [order the instance](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_orderinginstance#vc_orderinginstance-procedure), scroll down to the **Optional Services** section and click **vRealize Operations and Log Insight** in the **Management Tools** category. Follow the steps to add the service to your instance.

## Ordering vRealize Operations and Log Insight for an existing instance
{: #vrops_ordering-existing}

On the [instance details page](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_viewinginstances), click **Services** on the left navigation pane, click **vRealize Operations and Log Insight** in the **Management Tools** category, and then click **Add**. Follow the steps to add the service to your instance.

## vRealize Operations and Log Insight configuration
{: #vrops_ordering-config}

When you order the vRealize Operations and Log Insight service, you must specify whether you want to rent (include with purchase) the vRealize Operations and the vRealize LogInsight licenses from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or bring your own licenses (BYOL).

If you're planning to use your own vRealize Operations and vRealize Log Insight licenses (BYOL), ensure that the license keys are correct and that the license capacity is sufficient. The license keys and capacity are not verified during the service order.
