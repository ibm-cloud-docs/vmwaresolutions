# Adding ESXi servers to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingremovingservers}

New deployments of {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} multizone instances are not supported. For existing multizone instances, you can still add and delete clusters, add and delete ESXi servers, or add and delete storage.
{: deprecated}

You can expand the capacity of your existing {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances by adding VMwareÂ® ESXi servers to your witness, consolidated, workload, and gateway clusters.

## Procedure to add ESXi servers to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingremovingservers-adding-procedure}

1. {{site.data.content.ol-intro-ui-vcfclassic}}
2. In the **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-classic-short}}** table, click the instance for which you want to expand capacity.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab.
4. In the applicable cluster table, click the cluster to which you want to add ESXi servers.
5. In the **ESXi servers** section, click **Add**.
6. On the **Add ESXi server** side panel, enter the number of servers that you want to add. You can keep the **Maintenance mode** checkbox selected to add servers during maintenance mode.

   When you provision new ESXi servers, virtual machines (VMs) are immediately migrated to the new servers if you do not select the **Maintenance mode** checkbox. You do not receive a confirmation message before the migration begins.

7. Review the estimated price and click **Create**.

## Results after you add ESXi servers to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingremovingservers-adding-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console while the instance status changes from **Available** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to complete before you make more changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email that your request to add ESXi servers is being processed. On the console, the status of the cluster that is associated with the ESXi servers is changed to **Modifying**.
3. If you do not see the new ESXi servers added to the list in the cluster, check your email or console notifications for more details.

   If you are adding ESXi servers during maintenance mode, VMs are not migrated to the new servers until you remove maintenance mode.
