# Ordering on-premises HCX instances

You can order an on-premises HCX instance without associating it to any Cloud Foundation instance or vCenter Server instance for licensing and activation of your on-premises HCX installation.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
*  You configured the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [User accounts and settings](../vmonic/useraccount.html).
*  You reviewed all the considerations in [Considerations when installing on-premises HCX instances](../services/standalone_considerations.html).

## Procedure

1. Click **Getting Started** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **Order additional services** area, on the **HCX on IBM Cloud** card, click **Learn More**.
3. On the **HCX on IBM Cloud** page, click the **On-premises HCX** tab.
4. Specify the on-premises instance name.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Verify the instance configuration before you place the order.
   1. Review the settings for the instance.
   2. Review the monthly billing of the instance.
   3. Click the link or links of the terms that apply to your order, and ensure that you agree with these terms before you order the instance.
7. Click **Place Order**.

## Results

The ordering of the service activation key starts automatically. You receive confirmation that the order is being processed and you can check the status of the order by viewing the instance details.

When the activation key is ready to use, the status of the instance is changed to **Installed** and you receive a notification by email.

## What to do next

View and manage the on-premises HCX instance that you ordered.
