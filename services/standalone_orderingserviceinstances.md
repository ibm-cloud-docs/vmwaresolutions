# Ordering on-premises VMware HCX on IBM Cloud instances

You can order an on-premises HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} instance without associating it to any vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance for licensing and activation of your on-premises HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} installation.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
*  You configured the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [User accounts and settings](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic/useraccount.html).
*  You reviewed all the considerations in [Considerations when installing on-premises HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services/standalone_considerations.html).

## Procedure to order on-premises VMware HCX on IBM Cloud instances

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Deployed Instances** from the left navigation pane.
2. Scroll to the **On-premises HCX Instances** table and click **Provision New**.
3. Specify the **On-premises Instance Name**.
4. Click the link or links of the terms that apply to your order, and ensure that you agree with these terms before you order the instance.
5. Click **Provision**.

## Results

The ordering of the service activation key starts automatically. You receive confirmation that the order is being processed and you can check the status of the order by viewing the instance details.

When the activation key is ready to use, the status of the instance is changed to **Installed** and you receive a notification by email.

## What to do next

View and manage the on-premises HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance that you ordered.
