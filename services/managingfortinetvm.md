## Considerations when you delete FortiGate Virtual Appliance
{: #fortinetvm_considerations-remove}

Review the following considerations before you delete the service:

* Before you delete the FortiGate Virtual Appliance service, ensure that the configuration of the existing FortiGate Virtual Appliances is deleted correctly. Specifically, network traffic must be routed around FortiGate Virtual Appliances instead of through FortiGate Virtual Appliances. Otherwise, the existing data traffic within your environment might be impacted.
* If you installed the FortiGate Virtual Appliance service before VMware Solutions v4.0, and you then delete that service, you must manually remove the DNS entries. For more information, see [Manually removing the DNS entries](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletingservices#vc_deletingservices-DNS-entries).
