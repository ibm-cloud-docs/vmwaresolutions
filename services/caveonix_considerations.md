{: note}

A Caveonix RiskForesight license is valid for five years. Ordering Caveonix RiskForesight for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instances, {{site.data.keyword.rw}}, and Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances differs. For more information, see [Licenses and fees](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-caveonix_considerations#caveonix_considerations-tech-specs-license-fee).

## Technical specifications for Caveonix RiskForesight
{: #caveonix_considerations-specs}

For more information about resource requirements and capacity checking for some services, see [Resource requirements for services](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservices#vc_addingservices-resource-requirements).

The following components are ordered and included in the Caveonix RiskForesight service.

### {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} resources
{: #caveonix_considerations-tech-specs-vcenter}

* CPU - 8 CPUs
* RAM - 32 GB
* Disk - 100 GB

### Network
{: #caveonix_considerations-tech-specs-network}

A dedicated private subnet with 32 IP addresses is ordered.

### Licenses and fees
{: #caveonix_considerations-tech-specs-license-fee}

A Caveonix RiskForesight license key is ordered for each instance of the service.

If you order Caveonix RiskForesight for a {{site.data.keyword.rw}} or Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instance, you are charged for a per-host license for every host on the instance. This way of charging for Caveonix RiskForesight is new in version 4.1. However, you are not charged for per-VM licenses.

If you order Caveonix RiskForesight for a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instance, you are charged for the number of per-VM licenses that you choose at installation. This method of charging for Caveonix RiskForesight is the same as in previous releases. You can select 10 - 25,000 VMs to license.

If you order Caveonix RiskForesight for a {{site.data.keyword.rw}} or Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instance, the host-based licenses are hidden. Caveonix RiskForesight is deployed with a 25,000 VM key. You do not need to upgrade.

Caveonix RiskForesight licenses that are ordered separately from the Resources page are not per-host. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not order new Caveonix RiskForesight licenses and apply the key to your Caveonix RiskForesight service on {{site.data.keyword.rw}} or Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances. If you order in this way, the following things can occur:

* Provide less coverage than when the license was initially deployed.
* Result in you being charged twice for Caveonix RiskForesight licenses because your initial license cannot be canceled. Therefore, you pay for both per-host and per-VM licensing.

You can still order Caveonix RiskForesight licenses for other types of instances, for example, for VMware vServer Center instances.
