# Considerations for Caveonix RiskForesight licenses
{: #caveonix_license_considerations}

Review the following considerations before you delete the Caveonix RiskForesight licenses that you ordered for standalone use.

## Considerations when deleting Caveonix RiskForesight licenses
{: #caveonix_license_considerations-remove}

Removing a Caveonix RiskForesight license does not remove the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service that is installed on a vCenter Server instance. You must order a new Caveonix RiskForesight license or remove the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service from the vCenter Server instance in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console. For more information, see [Procedure to remove services for vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_addingremovingservices-removing-procedure).
