# Considerations for Caveonix RiskForesight licenses
{: #caveonix_license_considerations}

Review the following considerations and known issues that relate to the Caveonix RiskForesight licenses that you ordered for standalone use.

## Known issues about license date display
{: #caveonix_license_considerations-date}

If you are using Mozilla Firefox as your browser, the license starting and ending dates might be displayed with no values on the Caveonix RiskForesight console. To resolve the issue, view the license information in another browser, such as Google Chrome.

If the only browser you can use is Firefox, contact [Caveonix Support](https://www.caveonix.com/support/){:new_window} for assistance.

## Considerations when you delete licenses
{: #caveonix_license_considerations-remove}

Removing a Caveonix RiskForesight license does not remove the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service that is installed on a vCenter Server instance.

You must order a new Caveonix RiskForesight license or remove the Caveonix RiskForesight on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service from the vCenter Server instance in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console. For more information, see [Procedure to remove services for vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_addingremovingservices#vc_addingremovingservices-removing-procedure).
