# PrimaryIO Hybrid Cloud Data Management (HDM) overview
{: #managing_pio}

The PrimaryIO Hybrid Cloud Data Management (HDM) service decouples virtual machines (VMs) and storage (VMDKs) to seamlessly move workloads to and from {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} faster and efficiently. The PrimaryIO HDM solution enables a hybrid cloud environment to extend on-premises VMware® environments to the public cloud for on-demand compute capacity.

HDM has built-in functions to identify frequently used data, called hot data. Hot data is moved into an intelligent cloud cache, while less used data is moved to the background. This way, HDM can provision workloads in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} within minutes.

​HDM combines data I/O analysis with an intelligent cloud cache to decouple VMs and VMDKs for workload portability. It accomplishes workload mobility in three steps:
1. Analyze - Analyzes on-premises VMs and VMDKs and identifies VMs that are most suitable for the cloud.
   1. Identifies active data (hot data set) between VMs and VMDKs.
   2. Predicts the active data set to prefetch data.
   3. Recommends the minimal size of cache that is required for the VMs to quickly run in the cloud.
2. Cloud cache - Copies only the hot data set into the cloud cache instead of replicating the entire VMDK in the cloud storage. Minimizes the data footprint in the cloud.
3. Flex - Securely migrates the VMs (compute only) to the cloud, by using the hot data set in the cloud cache.

## Key benefits of HDM
{: #managing_pio-benefits}

PrimaryIO HDM enables the following use cases:
* **VM I/O Profiling**. HDM gives visibility into a VM’s disk I/O performance, including read/write patterns and disk access block size histograms for read/write transactions from and to the VMDKs.
* **Try-Before-Commit**. HDM enables rapid testing of applications in the cloud. It requires only a working set in the cloud cache and it avoids full data replication. The key benefits are reduced time and cost of testing in the cloud.
* **Cloud Extension**. HDM enables Development and Testing (Dev/Test) and seasonal workloads to use the cloud infrastructure for temporary use with minimal data exposure. Therefore, full replication of production data set in the cloud is avoided. The key benefits are - on-demand capacity, control on data exposure, and reduced costs.
* **Agile Migration**. HDM provides two different modes to migrate workloads to cloud:
   * Warm migration enables VMs to be migrated while the workloads are running in the cloud with only the working set until all the data is transferred. Upon successful transfer of the full data set, all data changes are synced and an updated VM is started in the cloud.
   * Cold migration migrates the VM along with data to the cloud. The VM is powered off until the transfer is completed.

## Technical specifications for PrimaryIO HDM
{: #managing_pio-specs}

For more information about resource requirements and capacity checking for some services, see [Resource requirements for add-on services](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservices#vc_addingservices-resource-requirements).

The following technical specifications apply to PrimaryIO HDM.

### HDM deployment configuration
{: #managing_pio-deploy-config}

* Cluster - Requires at least two VMware ESXi™ servers to ensure that HA requirements for the HDM product are met.
* Stand-alone - Requires at least one ESXi server.
* Appliance only - Requires that only the PIO Appliance is deployed. Recommended for cold migration only.
