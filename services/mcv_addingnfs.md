# Adding NFS storage to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingnfs-storage}

New deployments of {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} multizone instances are no longer supported. You can still add and delete clusters, add and remove ESXi servers, and add and delete storage for existing multizone instances.
{: deprecated}

You can expand the capacity of your {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} multizone instances by adding NFS storage to the witness and management clusters.

## Before you add NFS storage to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingnfs-storage-prereq}

* Do not add NFS storage from the VMware vSphereÂ® Web Client. The changes that you make on the vSphere Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
* IBM does not manage NFS file shares that you manually add to an instance.

## Procedure to add NFS storage to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingnfs-storage-procedure}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Resources** > **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}}** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}}** table, click the instance for which you want to expand capacity.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab.
4. In the applicable cluster table, click the cluster to which you want to add NFS storage.
5. In the **Storage** section, click **Add**.
6. In the **Add NFS storage** side panel, complete the storage configuration.
   * To add and configure the same settings to all file shares, specify the **Number of shares**, **Size (GB)**, and **Performance**.
   * To add and configure file shares individually, toggle the **Configure shares individually** switch on. Then, click **Add shared storage** and select the **Size (GB)** and **Performance** for each individual file share. You must select at least one file share.
7. Review the estimated price and click **Add**.

## Results after you add NFS storage to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} multizone instances
{: #mcv_addingnfs-storage-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console while the instance status changes from **Available** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to complete before you make more changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email that your request to add NFS storage is being processed. On the console, the status of the cluster that is associated with the NFS storage is changed to **Modifying**.
3. If you do not see that the new NFS storage is added to the list in the cluster, check your email or console notifications for more details.
