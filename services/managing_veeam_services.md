# Managed Backup Services
{: #managing_veeam_services}

The Veeam service seamlessly integrates with your VMware hypervisors to help your enterprise achieve high availability (HA). This service provides recovery points and time objectives for your applications and data. The recovery points and time objectives can be provided in less than 15 minutes after configuration is completed. Use this service to directly control both the backup and restore of all virtual machines for your infrastructure from the Veeam console.

IBM Resiliency Backup as a Service offers a robust range of onsite, offsite, and hybrid cloud-based data protection solutions to support information resiliency. For more information, see [IBM Resiliency Backup as a Service](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/managed-backup-services){:external}.

When you request managed backup services, you will get both Veeam backup software and IBM Resiliency Backup as a Service to deploy a fully managed backup environment. This combination helps you in the following ways:
* You have different data protection solutions to enable security-rich and automated protection of critical business data. This data is on dedicated on-premises environments, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructures, or IBM Resiliency Services Center, either as a primary or secondary location.
* You also get a scalable and flexible data protection solution to reduce the total cost of ownership and manage your compliance requirements.
