## What to do next
{: #np_viewinginstances-next}

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, the VMware vSphere Web Client, or the NetApp console.

Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance summary page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing your ESXi servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}}. Hover over the **vCenter console** button and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.
{:important}

For more information to help you complete the login instructions, review the following topics:

*  For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to the vSphere Web Client](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_timeout_vc_console).
*  For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure Private Network using VPN, see [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access){: external}.
*  If you have problems when you deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file using the vSphere Web Client, see [Deploying an OVF file using the vSphere Web Client](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_deploy_ovf).
