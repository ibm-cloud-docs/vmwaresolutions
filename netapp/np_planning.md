# Requirements and planning for NetApp ONTAP Select instances

Review the following requirements before you order your NetApp ONTAP Select instances. Plan your instance based on the IBM Cloud data center location and your workload performance and capacity requirements.

## IBM Cloud infrastructure account requirements

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure account that you are using must meet certain requirements. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account requirements](../vmonic/slaccountrequirement.html).

## Data centers availability

The NetApp ONTAP Select deployment has strict requirements on the physical infrastructure. Therefore, you can deploy instances only in IBMÂ® Cloud data centers that meet the requirements. The following data centers are available for NetApp ONTAP Select deployment:
