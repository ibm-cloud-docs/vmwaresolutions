# Requirements and planning for NetApp ONTAP Select instances

Review the following requirements before you order your NetApp ONTAP Select instances. Plan your instance based on the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent}} location and your workload performance and capacity requirements.

## IBM Cloud account requirements

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account that you are using must meet certain requirements. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account requirements](../vmonic/slaccountrequirement.html).

## IBM Cloud Data Center availability

The NetApp ONTAP Select deployment has strict requirements on the physical infrastructure. Therefore, you can deploy instances only in {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} that meet the requirements. The following {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} are available for NetApp ONTAP Select deployment:
