# Expanding and contracting capacity for VMware Regulated Workloads
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers}

Expand or contract the capacity of your VMware® Regulated Workloads instances according to your business needs, by adding or deleting VMware vSphere® ESXi™ servers or Network File System (NFS) storage.

## Before you add or delete ESXi servers
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers-before}

You must migrate the VMware vCenter Server® virtual machines (VMs) before you delete a server. This requirement applies to the vCenter Server VM and to the additional vCenter HA VMs on the management and witness clusters.

## Adding or deleting ESXi servers
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers-add-delete-esxi}

The processes to add and delete servers for VMware Regulated Workloads instances are similar to the ones for vCenter Server instances. For more information, see the following topics:
* [Adding ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservers)
* [Deleting ESXi servers from vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_removingservers)

## Adding or removing NFS storage
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers-add-delete-nfs}

The processes to add and remove NFS storage for VMware Regulated Workloads instances are similar to the ones for vCenter Server instances. For more information, see the following topics:
