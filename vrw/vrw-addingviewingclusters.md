# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for {{site.data.keyword.rw}}
{: #vrw-addingviewingclusters}



{{site.data.content.vrw-deprecated-note}}

You can add clusters to {{site.data.keyword.rw}} instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage VMware vSphere ESXiâ„¢ servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

The procedures to add, view, and delete clusters for {{site.data.keyword.rw}} instances are similar to the ones for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instances. For more information, see the following topics:
* [Adding clusters to Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingclusters)
* [Viewing clusters for Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewingclusters)
* [Deleting clusters from Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletingclusters)
