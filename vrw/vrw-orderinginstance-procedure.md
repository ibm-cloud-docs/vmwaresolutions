# Procedure to order {{site.data.keyword.rw}}
{: #vrw-orderinginstance-procedure}



1. In the VMware Solutions console, click the **VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) for Classic** card in the **Create a resource** section. {: #step-1}
1. On the **Create** tab, click the **{{site.data.keyword.rw}}** card in the **Resource type** section.
1. Review the service prerequisites and confirm that you ordered the mandatory services listed.
1. Enter the instance name and select a resource group. Then, select the vCenter Server version.
1. To specify the instance configuration name, click **Browse configurations** and choose a configuration in the **VMware instance configuration manager**.
   * If you do not see any configurations in the list and you want to create one, you must first save the instance settings as a new configuration without placing an order.
   * If you want to update a saved configuration or create a new configuration based on a saved one, select the configuration from the side pane, make your changes, and then save.
1. If you are a BYOL user, provide your own license keys for all VMware components. Toggle the **BYOL** switch to **Enabled** and enter your license keys.

   1. Review the summary.
   1. Review the estimated resources available per cluster.
   1. Review the networking type and select the uplink speed.
1. Specify the settings for the additional workload cluster. For VMware instances with a customizable consolidated cluster, optionally toggle the **Include a separate cluster for workloads** switch on and complete the cluster settings.
   1. Specify the cluster name.
   1. Select the workload capacity. For the **Customizable** capacity, select the CPU model and RAM size.
   1. For the **CPU model**, select **Sapphire Rapids** or **Cascade Lake** and choose one of the available configurations.

   * For all appliance options, specify the [gateway cluster name](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vrw-orderinginstance-edge#vrw-orderinginstance-edge-cluster-name), the CPU model, the RAM size, and the networking type.
   * For **Gateway cluster with Juniper vSRX** and **Gateway cluster with FortiGate Virtual Appliance**, you must also specify the corresponding service settings in a later step.
   * For **FortiGate Security Appliance**, you must order the **FortiGate Security Appliance 10 Gbps** service from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/netsec/firewalls/multi-vlan/provision#about). Confirm that you ordered the service and continue with the following steps.

1. Select any other optional services for deployment by toggling their switch on and reviewing the service settings. If configuration is required, click **Edit**, then complete the edits and click **Save**. For more information, see [VMware HCX configuration](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-hcx_ordering#hcx_ordering-config) or [Considerations when you install F5 BIG-IP](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-f5_considerations#f5_considerations-install).

1. To place the order, ensure that the account to be charged is correct, review and accept the terms, and then click **Create**.

## Results if you saved a configuration
{: #vrw-orderinginstance-results-config}

You get a console notification that the configuration is saved successfully, and then you can find the template in the **Instance configurations** list. Next, you can manage the configuration template by viewing or deleting it in the **Instance configurations** list.

## Results if you placed an order
{: #vrw-orderinginstance-results-order}

1. The deployment of the regulated workload instance starts automatically and you receive confirmation that the order is being processed. You can check the deployment status, including any issues that might require your attention, by viewing the **Deployment history** tab of the instance details.
2. When the instance is successfully deployed, the ordered components are installed on your VMware virtual platform. The deployment of the services starts after your order is completed. When the instance is ready to use, its status changes to **Available**, and you receive a notification by email.

Manage the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components that are created in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account only in the VMware Solutions console, not the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, or any other means outside of the console.
If you change these components outside of the VMware Solutions console, the changes are not synchronized with the console.
