# Getting started with VMware Solutions
{: #getting-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="2h"}

In this {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} getting started tutorial, we take you through the process of ordering an instance and some services for it.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #getting-started-prereqs}

Before you start to work with {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}}, review the following important information about browser requirements, users accounts, deployment options, and services.

### Browser requirements
{: #getting-started-browser-req}

For more information, see [Browsers](/docs/overview?topic=overview-prereqs-platform#browsers-platform).

### User accounts
{: #getting-started-user-accts}

You need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account. These accounts must meet certain requirements.

| Account | Description |
|:------- |:---------- |
| IBMid | By using the **IBMid**, you can have a single login username for all IBM products and services that you use, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} is provided as an infrastructure solution in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. To access the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you must have an **IBMid**. \n \n To use your **IBMid** to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you must associate the **IBMid** with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. When you log in to the console for the first time, you are asked to associate your existing **IBMid** with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, or to sign up for a new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. The new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account is automatically associated with your **IBMid**. You go through this process only one time. \n \n If you have problems when you associate your **IBMid** with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, see [Why is my password incorrect?](/docs/account?topic=account-ts_logintoibm) |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account | To order and use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account is required. Billing information is associated with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. The price of the physical and virtual infrastructure and the resulting licenses are charged to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account | If you have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account, link it with your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account by following the procedure in [Upgrading your account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account). If you do not have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account, request one by following the procedure in [The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-signing_required_accounts#signing_required_accounts-infra). Then, link it to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account by following the previous procedure. \n \n When you link your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account with your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, you can use the combined IaaS (infrastructure as a service) and PaaS (platform as a service) resources, and access these resources from a single login. It also provides you with a single invoice for all the PaaS and IaaS resources that you use. |

## Accessing the VMware Solutions console
{: #getting-started-step1}
{: step}

The VMware Solutions console is the user interface where you order and manage your deployments. Each deployment is managed as an instance in the console. The console is a stand-alone user interface that is separate from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure customer portal.

To access the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console:
1. Go to https://cloud.ibm.com/vmware.
2. Log in to the console with your **IBMid**.

## Setting up your environment for your first order
{: #getting-started-step2}
{: step}

Decide upon a deployment offering, which is managed as an instance in the console, and then ensure that your environment is ready for your order. Follow the instructions in the **Before you begin** section on the ordering page. The instructions might vary depending on the instance type that you select.

For more information about how to set up your environment for your first order, see [Setting up your environment for your first order](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-completing_checklist).

## Ordering an instance
{: #getting-started-step3}
{: step}

After you set up your environment properly, begin the ordering process.

For more information about how to order an instance, see the following topics based on your selected deployment:
* [Ordering {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-tenant-ordering)
* [Ordering Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_orderinginstance-req)
* [Ordering Flexible instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_orderinginstances-req)
* [Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cr}} instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-cr_orderinginstance_reqs)
* [Ordering {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-vcf-order-req)

## Viewing the instance
{: #getting-started-step4}
{: step}

After you place an instance order in **Step 3**, the deployment of the instance starts automatically. You can track the status of the deployment by viewing the instance details. When the instance deployment is completed, you can view the summary and detailed information of the instance and its services on the instance details page too.

For more information about how to view the instance you ordered, see the following topics based on your selected deployment:
* [Viewing {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-tenant-viewing-sites)
* [Viewing Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewinginstances)
* [Viewing Flexible instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vs_viewinginstances)
* [Viewing and deleting {{site.data.keyword.cr}} instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-cr-view-delete-instance)
* [Viewing {{site.data.keyword.vcf-vpc-short}} instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-vcf-viewing)
