### User accounts
{: #getting-started-user-accts}

You need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account. These accounts must meet certain requirements.

| Account | Description |
|:------- |:---------- |
| IBMid | By using the **IBMid**, you can have a single login user name for all IBM products and services that you use, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} is provided as an infrastructure solution in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. To access the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you must have an **IBMid**.<br><br>To use your **IBMid** to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you must associate the **IBMid** with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. When you log in to the console for the first time, you are guided to either associate your existing **IBMid** with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, or to sign up for a new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. The new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account is automatically associated with your **IBMid**.

## Step 1: Accessing the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions console
{: #getting-started-step1}

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console is the interface where you order and manage your deployments. Each deployment is managed as an instance in the console. The console is a stand-alone user interface that is separate from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure customer portal.

To access the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console:
1. Go to https://cloud.ibm.com/infrastructure/vmware-solutions/console.
2. Log in to the console with your **IBMid**.

## Step 2: Configuring your user account and settings
{: #getting-started-step2}

Before you order an instance, you must enter the user name and API key of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account on the **Settings** page of the console.

For information about how to configure your user account and settings, see [Managing user accounts and settings](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-useraccount).

## Step 3: Ordering an instance
{: #getting-started-step3}

After you decide upon a deployment offering, which is managed as an instance in the console, begin the ordering process.

For information about how to order an instance, see the following topics based on your selection of deployment offering:
* [Ordering vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_orderinginstance)
* [Ordering vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_orderinginstance)
* [Ordering new vSphere clusters](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vsphere?topic=vmware-solutions-vs_orderinginstances)
* [Ordering NetApp ONTAP Select instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/netapp?topic=vmware-solutions-np_orderinginstances)

## Step 4: Viewing the instance
{: #getting-started-step4}

After you place an instance order in **Step 3**, the deployment of the instance starts automatically. You can track the status of the deployment by viewing the instance details. When the instance deployment is completed, you can view the summary and detailed information of the instance and its add-on services on the instance details page too.

For information about how to view the instance you ordered, see the following topics:
* [Viewing vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_viewinginstances)
* [Viewing vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_viewinginstances)
* [Viewing NetApp ONTAP Select instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services?topic=vmware-solutions-np_viewinginstances#np_viewinginstances)
