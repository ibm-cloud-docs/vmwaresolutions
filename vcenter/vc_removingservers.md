# Deleting ESXi servers from {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instances
{: #vc_removingservers}

{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

You can contract the capacity of your {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instance according to your business needs by deleting VMware ESXiâ„¢ servers.

## Before you delete ESXi servers from Automated instances
{: #vc_removingservers-prereq}

{{site.data.content.para-vcenterremoveESXiservers}}

* For the gateway cluster, you cannot add or delete ESXi servers.
* When you delete ESXi servers, the servers are placed in maintenance mode, and then, all the virtual machines (VMs) running on the servers are migrated before they are deleted from vCenter Server. For maximum of control over the relocation of VMs, place the ESXi servers in maintenance mode and migrate the VMs running on them manually using the VMware vSphere Web Client. After that, delete the ESXi servers by using the VMware Solutions console.
* If you are using NFS storage, your instance requires at least three ESXi servers for a consolidated cluster or at least two servers for any other cluster.
* If you are using vSAN storage, at least four ESXi servers are required.

## Procedure to delete ESXi servers from Automated instances
{: #vc_removingservers-procedure}

1. {{site.data.content.ol-intro-ui-vcfclassic}}
2. In the **{{site.data.keyword.vcf-classic}}** table, click the instance for which you want to contract capacity.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab.
4. In the applicable cluster table, click the cluster from which you want to delete ESXi servers.
5. In the **ESXi servers** section, select the servers that you want to delete and click **Delete**.
6. Click **Delete** in the **Delete ESXi server** window.

## Results after you delete ESXi servers from Automated instances
{: #vc_removingservers-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console, while the instance status changes from **Available** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to complete before you make more changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email that your request to delete ESXi servers is being processed. On the console, the status of the cluster that is associated with the ESXi servers is changed to **Modifying**.
3. The ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure at the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle, which is typically 30 days.

   You are billed until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle for the deleted ESXi servers.
