## Procedure to view access information for Automated instances
{: #vc_viewinginstances-procedure-view-access-info}

On the **Access information** tab, view the access information for the instance-related components. The passwords that are displayed are initial passwords that are generated by the system. If you change them outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, they are not updated on the **Access information** tab.

| Component | Description |
|:--------- |:----------- |
| IP[^ips] | The IP address or addresses of the AD server or servers. |
| FQDN[^fqdn] | The AD/DNS server fully qualified domain names (FQDN). \n \n The same administrator password can be used to connect to all AD/DNS servers by using a remote desktop connection. |
| ADMIN (Remote Desktop) | For primary instances, it displays the username and password to access the AD server through a remote desktop connection. \n \n For secondary instances, click the **View on primary instance** link to be directed to the username and password information on the primary instance. \n \n After the secondary instance is added to the primary DNS domain and replication occurs, the local administrator password on the primary instance might overwrite the local administrator password on the secondary instance. By clicking the **View on primary instance** link, you receive access to the correct administrator password. |

## What to do next
{: #vc_viewinginstances-next}

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console or the VMware vSphere Web Client.

Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance summary page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing your VMware ESXi™ servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. Hover over **vCenter console** and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.
{: important}

Review the following topics for information to help you complete the login instructions:
*  For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to the vSphere Web Client](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_timeout_vc_console).
*  For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure Private Network by using VPN, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Networking](/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-getting-started).
*  If you have problems when you deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file by using the vSphere Web Client, see [Deploying an OVF file using the vSphere Web Client](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_deploy_ovf).
