## Viewing vCenter Server instances property details

To view the property details of an instance, click an instance name.

Table 3. vCenter Server instances property details

|:------------- |:------------- |
| ID | The ID of the instance |
| Name | The name of the instance |
| Location | The {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} where the instance is hosted |
| Current version | The current version of {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} |
| vCenter version | The VMware vCenter Server version |
|  | **Note**: There is a slight variation between the vCenter Server version displayed on the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console and the VMware vSphere Web Client. Both are correct.|
| NSX for vSphere | The VMware NSX for vSphere product version |
| _VMware component_ license | If you selected to use your own VMware license for any of the VMware components on the **Licensing** page when you ordered the instance, the VMware component name and the license key that you entered for the component are displayed. |
|  | Examples of VMware component licenses can include: **NSX License**, **vCenter Server License**, and **vSAN License**. |
| NSX license edition | The version and edition of the VMware NSX license |
| DNS, Root Domain | The root domain name is the DNS (Domain Name System) domain name and the Microsoft Active Directory (AD) forest root name. |
| DNS, SSO Domain | The SSO domain is the vSphere Single Sign-On domain. The SSO domain name is fixed for all deployed vCenter Server instances with a value of <samp class="ph codeph">vsphere.local</samp>. |
| DNS, Subdomain | The subdomain is the DNS subdomain name of the root domain name where the local vCenter Server instance host names reside. The subdomain name is in the format <samp class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">vcenter_server_instance_name</var>.<var class="keyword varname">root.domain_name</var></samp>. |
| Status  | The status of the instance |
|         | The information that is displayed provides an update on the progress of the deployment or the action that is taken on the instance. If there are issues, a message might be displayed to help you investigate and resolve the problem. |

## Viewing access information for vCenter Server instances

From the **Summary** page, you can view the access information for the instance-related components. The passwords displayed are initial passwords that are generated by the system. If you change them outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, they are not updated on the instance details page.

Table 4. vCenter Server access information for instance-related components

| Component        | Description       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| AD/DNS IPs | The IP addresses of the two AD servers |
| AD/DNS FQDNs | The AD/DNS server fully qualified domain names  |
|  | **Note:** The same administrator password can be used to remote desktop into all of the AD/DNS servers. |
| AD/DNS ADMIN (Remote Desktop)  | For primary instances, it displays the user name and password to access the AD server via a remote desktop connection.  |
|   | For secondary instances, click the **View on primary instance** link to be directed to the user name and password information on the primary instance. |
|   | **Note**: After the secondary instance is added to the primary DNS domain and replication occurs, the local administrator password on the primary instance might overwrite the local administrator password on the secondary instance. By clicking the **View on primary instance** link, you will get access to the correct administrator password.  |
| NSX Manager IP  | The IP address of the NSX Manager  |
| NSX Manager FQDN  | The NSX Manager fully qualified domain name (FQDN)  |
| NSX Manager HTTP  | The user name and password used to access the NSX Manager web console |
| PSC IP  | The IP address of the Platform Services Controller (PSC)  |
| PSC FQDN  | The PSC fully qualified domain name (FQDN)  |    
| PSC ADMIN  | The VMware vCenter Single Sign-On user name and password that you can use to access the PSC web console  |
| PSC SSH  | The user name and password that you can use to access the PSC VM via SSH connection  |
| vCenter IP  | The IP address of the vCenter Server  |
| vCenter FQDN  | The vCenter Server fully qualified domain name (FQDN)  |
| vCenter ADMIN  | The VMware vCenter Single Sign-On user name and password that you can use to log in to the vCenter Server by using the vSphere Web Client  |
| vCenter SSH  | The user name and password that you can use to access the vCenter Server VM via SSH connection  |

## Viewing the deployment history for vCenter Server instances

From the **Summary** page, you can view the deployment history for the instance.

Table 5. vCenter Server instance deployment history

| Item        | Description       |  
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Date | The date and time when the instance status is changed |
| Summary | The details of the change |

## What to do if errors occur

If errors occur during instance deployment or instance deletion, an IBM Cloud Support ticket is created automatically on your behalf. You can click the ticket link to check its status and progress.

## What to do next

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console or the VMware vSphere Web Client.

**Important**: Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance details page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing your ESXi servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}}. Hover over the **vCenter console** button and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.

Review the following topics for information to help you complete the login instructions:
*  For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to the vSphere Web Client](../vmonic/trbl_timeout_vc_console.html).
*  For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure (SoftLayer) Private Network using VPN, see [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access){:new_window}.
*  If you have problems when you deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file using the vSphere Web Client, see [Deploying an OVF file using the vSphere Web Client](../vmonic/trbl_deploy_ovf.html).
