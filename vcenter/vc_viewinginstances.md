# Viewing vCenter Server instances

Use this procedure to view the VMware vCenter Server instances that you ordered and detailed information about them.

## Procedure

1. Click **Deployed Instances** from the left navigation pane. In the **vCenter Server Instances** table, view the summary about the ordered instances:

  * **Name**: The name of the instance.
  * **Version**: The release version that the instance was deployed in or upgraded to.
  * **Location**: The data center where the instance is hosted.
  * **Creation Time**: The date and time that the instance was created.
  * **Status**: The status of the instance. The status can have one of the following values:
     <dl class="dl">
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Creating</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The instance is being created.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Building</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The instance is being configured.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Ready to Use</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The instance is ready to use.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Modifying </dt>
     <dd class="dd">The instance is being modified.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Failed</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The creation, configuration, or modification process failed.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Deleting</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The instance is being deleted.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Deletion Error</dt>
     <dd class="dd">An error occurred when the instance was being deleted.</dd>
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Deleted</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The instance is deleted.</dd>
     </dl>
  * **Actions**: Take the following actions on the instance:
    <dl class="dl">
    <dt class="dt dlterm">Delete</dt>
    <dd class="dd">Delete the instance.</dd>
    </dl>

2. Click an instance to see the property details. Ensure that you are on the **Summary** tab.

  * **ID**: The ID of the instance.
  * **Name**: The name of the instance.
  * **Location**: The data center where the instance is hosted.
  * **Current version**: The current version of {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}}.
  * **vCenter version**: The version of VMware vCenter Server.

    **Note**: There is a slight variation between the vCenter Server version displayed on the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console and the VMware vSphere Web Client. Both are correct.

  * **NSX for vSphere**: The VMware NSX for vSphere product version.
  * _**VMware component**_ **License**: If you selected to use your own VMware license for any of the VMware components on the **Licensing** page when you were ordering the instance, the VMware component name and the license key string you entered for the component are displayed.

    Examples of VMware component licenses can include **NSX License**, **vCenter Server License**, and **vSAN License**.
  * **NSX license edition**: The version and edition of the VMware NSX license.
  * **DNS**:
    <dl class="dl">
           <dt class="dt dlterm">Root Domain</dt>
    <dd class="dd">The root domain name is the DNS (Domain Name System) domain name and the Microsoft Active Directory (AD) forest root name.</dd>
    <dt class="dt dlterm">SSO Domain</dt>
    <dd class="dd">The SSO domain is the vSphere Single Sign-On domain. The SSO domain name is fixed for all deployed vCenter Server instances with a value of <samp class="ph codeph">vsphere.local</samp>.</dd>
    <dt class="dt dlterm">Subdomain</dt>
    <dd class="dd">The subdomain is the DNS subdomain name of the root domain name where the local vCenter Server instance host names reside. The subdomain name is in the format <samp class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">vcenter_server_instance_name</var>.<var class="keyword varname">root.domain_name</var></samp>.</dd>
    </dl>
  * **Status**: The status of the instance.

3. View the access information for the instance-related components. These passwords are initial passwords that are generated by the system. If you change them outside window of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console, they are not updated on the instance details page.

  * **AD/DNS IP**: The IP address of the AD server.
  * **AD/DNS FQDN**: The AD/DNS server fully qualified domain name.
  * **AD/DNS ADMIN (Remote Desktop)**: For primary instances, this field displays the user name and password that you can use to access the AD server via a remote desktop connection.

    For secondary instances, click the **View on primary instance** link to be directed to the user name and password information on the primary instance.

    **Note**: After the secondary instance is added to the primary DNS domain and replication occurs, the local administrator password on the primary instance might overwrite the local administrator password on the secondary instance. By clicking the **View on primary instance** link, you will get access to the correct administrator password.
  * **NSX Manager IP**: The IP address of the NSX Manager.
  * **NSX Manager FQDN**: The NSX Manager fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
  * **NSX Manager HTTP**: The user name and password that you can use to access the NSX Manager web console.
  * **PSC IP**: The IP address of the Platform Services Controller (PSC).
  * **PSC FQDN**: The PSC fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
  * **PSC ADMIN**: The VMware vCenter Single Sign-On user name and password that you can use to access the PSC web console.
  * **PSC SSH**: The user name and password that you can use to access the PSC VM via SSH connection.
  * **vCenter IP**: The IP address of the vCenter Server.
  * **vCenter FQDN**: The vCenter Server fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
  * **vCenter ADMIN**: The VMware vCenter Single Sign-On user name and password that you can use to log in to the vCenter Server by using the vSphere Web Client.
  * **vCenter SSH**: The user name and password that you can use to access the vCenter Server VM via SSH connection.  

4. View the deployment history for the instance.

  * **Date**: The date and time when the instance status is changed.
  * **Summary**: The details of the change.

    If errors occur during instance deployment or instance deletion, an IBM Cloud Support ticket is created automatically on your behalf. You can click the ticket link to check its status and progress.

## What to do next

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console or the VMware vSphere Web Client.

**Important**: Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance details page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing
your ESXi servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the IBM Cloud data center. Hover over the **vCenter console** button and
follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere
Web Client.

Review the following topics for information to help you complete the login instructions:

*  For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to
   the vSphere Web Client](../vmonic/trbl_timeout_vc_console.html).
*  For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure (SoftLayer) Private Network using VPN, see [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access){:new_window}.
*  If you have problems when you deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file using the vSphere Web Client, see [Deploying an OVF file using the vSphere Web Client](../vmonic/trbl_deploy_ovf.html).
