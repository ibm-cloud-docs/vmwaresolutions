# Deleting vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances
{: #vc_hybrid_deletinginstance}

To release the components that you ordered in a VMware vCenter Server® with Hybridity Bundle instance, delete the instance.

When you delete a vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance, the following components are released sequentially:
1. All deployed services
2. Support and Services fee
3. VMware® product licenses
4. VMware ESXi™ servers
5. Subnets
6. VLANs

Any VLANs that have your own resources added to them, such as gateways, Veeam® servers, and so on, are not deleted. In addition, any existing VLANs that you own, outside of {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}}, are not deleted.
{: note}

Because of resource dependencies, the components in your instance are not released immediately when you delete the instance. For example, the subnets and VLANs cannot be deleted until the ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure, which happens at the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle. At the end of the billing cycle, which is typically 30 days, the subnets and VLANs are deleted and the instance deletion is completed.

You are billed until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle for the deleted instance.
