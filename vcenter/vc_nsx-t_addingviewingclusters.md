# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for vCenter Server with NSX-T instances
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingcluster}

The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped as **cluster1** by default.

You can add your own clusters to VMware vCenter Server with NSX-T instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage ESXi servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

## Adding clusters to vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding}

The number of clusters, hosts, and virtual machines (VMs) determines the maximum limit for the number of clusters you can add. You must remain within the VMware sizing guidelines and limits for your deployment.

For more information about maximum limits, see [VMware Configuration Maximums](https://configmax.vmware.com/home){:new_window}.

### System settings
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-sys-settings}

When you add a cluster for a vCenter Server with NSX-T instance, you must specify the following settings.

#### Cluster name
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-cluster-name}

The cluster name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The cluster name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum number of characters is 30.
* The cluster name must be unique within the vCenter Server instance.

#### Data center location
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-dc-location}

The {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent}} location of the cluster is set to the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} of the vCenter Server instance by default. You can deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} than the deployed instance, but you must ensure that the network latency between the two {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} is less than 150 ms. To check the network latency, you can use a tool such as [SoftLayer IP Backbone Looking Glass](http://lg.softlayer.com/).

If you deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure pod, three extra VLANs are ordered for use with the ordered {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

### Bare Metal Server settings
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-bare-metal-settings}

You can choose **Skylake**, **SAP-certified**, or **Broadwell**.

#### Skylake
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-skylake}

For the **Skylake** setting, you have options for the **CPU Model** and **RAM**. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

#### Number of Bare Metal Servers
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-bare-metal-number}

Clusters require at least three {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

You can add up to 59 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} for a cluster. You can add 1 - 59 ESXi servers at a time.

After deployment, you can create up to four more clusters. If you select the **Skylake** or **Broadwell** Bare Metal Server configuration with VMware vSAN storage, four servers are required for both the initial cluster and post-deployment clusters.

### Storage settings
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-storage-settings}

Storage settings are based on your selection of Bare Metal Server configuration and the storage type.

#### vSAN storage
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-vsan-storage}

Specify the following vSAN options:
* **Disk Type and Size for vSAN Capacity Disks**: Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.
* **Number of vSAN Capacity Disks**: Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.
* If you want to add capacity disks over the limit of eight, check the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of 10 capacity disks and is useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput.

  The **High-Performance Intel Optane** option is available only for the Skylake CPU models Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140.
  {:note}

* Review the **Disk Type for vSAN Cache Disks** and **Number of vSAN Cache Disks** values. These values depend on whether you checked the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box.
* **vSAN License**: Use the IBM-provided VMware license for the vSAN component by selecting **Include with purchase**, or Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license key.

If your initial cluster was a vSAN cluster, any additional vSAN clusters use the same vSAN license and have the same configuration as the initial one. This is also true if any cluster in the instance has vSAN chosen to be deployed on it (initial or additional). The first time you're prompted for the vSAN license (BYOL or purchased) and the edition. The next time that you select vSAN for a new cluster, the license that is chosen initially is reused.

#### NFS storage
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-nfs-storage}

When you select **NFS Storage**, you can add file-level shared storage for your instance where all shares use the same settings or you can specify different configuration settings for each file share. Specify the following NFS options:

The number of file shares must be in the range of 1 to 32.
{:note}

* **Configure shares individually**: Select to specify different configuration settings for each file share.
* **Number of Shares**: When want to use the same configuration setting for each file share, specify the number of file shares for the NFS shared storage that you want to add.
* **Size**: Select the capacity that meets your shared storage needs.
* **Performance**: Select the IOPS (input/output operations per second) per GB based on your workload requirements.
* **ADD NFS**: Select to add individual file shares with different configuration settings.

Table 3. NFS performance level options

| Option        | Details       |
  |:------------- |:------------- |
  | 0.25 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for workloads that are not used often. Example applications include: vaulted data, hosting large databases with legacy data, or virtual disk images of virtual memory system as backup. |
  | 2 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for most general-purpose workloads. Example applications include: hosting small databases, backing up web applications, or virtual machine (VM) disk images for a hypervisor. |
  | 4 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for higher-intensity workloads that have a high percentage of active data at a time. Example applications include: transactional databases. |
  | 10 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for the most demanding workload types, such as analytics. Example applications include: high-transaction databases and other performance-sensitive databases. This performance level is limited to a maximum capacity of 4 TB per file share. |

### Local Disks
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-local-disks}

The local disks option is available for the **SAP-certified** Quad Intel Xeon E7-8890 v4 processor Bare Metal configuration only. Specify the following options:
* **Disk Count**: Select the number of disks that you want to add.
* **Disk type**: Select an option for the disk type that you need.

### Licensing settings
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-licensing-settings}

Specify the licensing option for the VMware vSphere component in the cluster:
* For Business Partner users, the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition) is included and purchased on your behalf.
* For non-Business Partner users, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for this component by selecting **Include with purchase**, or you can Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license key.

### Network interface settings
{: #vc_nsx-t_addingviewingclusters-adding-network-interface-settings}

Network interface card (NIC) enablement settings are based on your selection of either **Public and Private Network** or **Private Network Only**.

### Order summary
