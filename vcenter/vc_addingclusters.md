# Adding clusters to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instances
{: #vc_addingclusters}

You can add clusters to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage VMware ESXi™ servers for better resource allocation and high availability (HA).

Adding clusters to instances with VMware vSphere® 6.5 or 6.7 is not supported.
{: deprecated}

## Before you add clusters to Automated instances
{: #vc_addingclusters-before}

{{site.data.content.para-vcenteraddclusters}}

* New clusters are provisioned with mirrored M.2 boot drives.
* The number of clusters, hosts, and virtual machines (VMs) determines the maximum number of clusters that you can add. Remain within the VMware® sizing guidelines and limits for your deployment. For more information, see [VMware configuration maximums](https://configmax.broadcom.com/home){: external}.
* You can add a cluster while another cluster is being created or deleted.
* For clusters that belong to vCenter Server 8 instances, you can select a vSphere version.

## Cluster type
{: #vc_addingclusters-cluster-type}

Select the cluster type: **Workload cluster** or **Gateway cluster**.

## System settings for workload clusters
{: #vc_addingclusters-sys-settings-workload}

When you add a workload cluster to an Automated instance, you must specify the following settings.

### VMware vSphere version (vCenter Server 8 instances only)
{: #vc_addingclusters-vpshere-version}

Select the vSphere version for the cluster.

### Cluster name
{: #vc_addingclusters-cluster-name}

The cluster name is set to **vcs-_xx_** by default, where _xx_ represents two randomly generated alphabetic characters.

{{site.data.content.cluster-name-requirements-list}}

### Licensing settings (BYOL only)
{: #vc_addingclusters-licensing-settings}

{{site.data.content.attnnote-byol}}

If you are a BYOL user, provide your own license key for vSphere:
* Select **I will provide** and enter your own vSphere license key.
* Select **Use existing license** only if you are using a BYOL vSphere license for your instance. When the option is enabled, you can select the existing license only if the instance has enough capacity for the additional hosts.

### Bare metal server settings
{: #vc_addingclusters-bare-metal-settings}

The CPU models differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in. You can choose from **Sapphire Rapids**, **Cascade Lake**, and **SAP-certified Cascade Lake** servers[^1u].

[^1u]: For clusters with NFS storage, where locations with appropriate 1U servers are available, 1U servers (up to 4 drives of storage) are ordered silently rather than 2U servers. For gateway clusters and clusters with vSAN storage, 2U servers are ordered.

#### Data center location
{: #vc_addingclusters-dc-location}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center location of the cluster is set to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center of the Automated instance by default. You can deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center than the deployed instance if you ensure that the network latency between the two {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers is less than 150 ms.

If you deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure pod, three extra VLANs are ordered for use with the ordered {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal servers.

#### Sapphire Rapids
{: #vc_addingclusters-sapphire}

{{site.data.content.sapphire-para-intro}}

{{site.data.content.simpletabtable-sapphire}}

{{site.data.content.note-spr-rapids-byol}}



#### Cascade Lake
{: #vc_addingclusters-cascade}

{{site.data.content.cascade-para-intro}}

{{site.data.content.simpletabtable-cascade}}

#### SAP-certified Cascade Lake
{: #vc_addingclusters-sap}

{{site.data.content.sap-para-intro}}

{{site.data.content.simpletabtable-sap-netweaver}}

{{site.data.content.simpletabtable-sap-hana}}

vSphere 8 is not supported for SAP-certified Cascade Lake servers.
{: important}

#### Number of bare metal servers
{: #vc_addingclusters-bare-metal-number}

{{site.data.content.number-of-baremetal-servers-wkld}}

### Storage settings
{: #vc_addingclusters-storage-settings}

Storage settings are based on your selection of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server configuration and the storage type.

You can add NFS storage shares to an existing vSAN or NFS cluster. For more information, see [Adding NFS storage to Automated instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingnfs).
{: note}

#### NFS storage
{: #vc_addingclusters-nfs-storage}

When you select **NFS storage**, you can add file-level shared storage for your instance where all shares use the same settings or you can specify different configuration settings for each file share. The number of file shares must be in the range of 1 to 100.

NFS storage is available for instances with vSphere 7 and vSphere 8.
{: important}

Specify the following NFS options.
* **Configure shares individually** - Toggle this switch on to specify different configuration settings for each file share.
* **Number of shares** - If you want to use the same configuration setting for each file share, specify the number of file shares for the NFS shared storage that you want to add.
* **Size (GB)** - Select the capacity that meets your shared storage needs.
* **Performance** - Select the IOPS (input/output operations per second) per GB based on your workload requirements.
* **Add shared storage** - Select to add individual file shares with different configuration settings.

The following table indicates the performance level details.

| Option | Details |
|:------ |:------- |
| 0.25 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for workloads that are not used often. Example applications include vaulted data, hosting large databases with legacy data, or virtual disk images of virtual memory system as backup. |
| 2 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for most general-purpose workloads. Example applications include hosting small databases, backing up web applications, or VM disk images for a hypervisor. |
| 4 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for higher-intensity workloads that have a high percentage of active data at a time. Example applications include transactional databases. |
| 10 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for the most demanding workload types, such as analytics. Example applications include high-transaction databases and other performance-sensitive databases. This performance level is limited to a maximum capacity of 4 TB per file share. |

#### vSAN storage
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-storage}

Review the following vSAN options.

##### Storage architecture
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-storage-archi}

{{site.data.content.storage-arch-spr-intro}}

{{site.data.content.storage-arch-spr}}

##### Size for vSAN capacity disks
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-capacity-size}

Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.

##### Number of vSAN capacity disks
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-capacity-number}

Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.

If you want to add more capacity disks, select the **High performance with Intel Optane** checkbox. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays, which are useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput.

The **High performance with Intel Optane** option is available only for instances with vSphere 6.
{: note}

##### Size for vSAN cache disks
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-cache-size}

Review the **Size for vSAN cache disks** value. The value depends on whether you checked the **High performance with Intel Optane** box.

##### Number of vSAN cache disks
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-cache-number}

Review **Number of vSAN cache disks**. The value depends on whether you checked the **High performance with Intel Optane** box.

##### Enable vSAN deduplication and compression
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-storage-enable-comp}

vSAN storage depends on the number of servers and your total disk capacity, and the use of deduplication and compression.

The amount of storage reduction from deduplication and compression depends on many factors, including the type of data stored and the number of duplicate blocks. Larger disk groups tend to provide a higher deduplication ratio. For more information, see [Using deduplication and compression](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsan/vsan/7-0/vsan-adminstration-7-0/increasing-space-efficiency-in-a-vsan-cluster/using-deduplication-and-compression-in-vsan-cluster.html){: external}.
{: note}

##### Enable vSAN compression (vSAN ESA only)
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-storage-enable-comp-esa}

vSAN storage depends on the number of servers and your total disk capacity, and the use of deduplication. For Sapphire Rapids servers, both vSAN ESA and vSAN OSA are available. However, the **Enable vSAN compression** option is available only for vSAN ESA. For more information, see [Storage architecture](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingclusters#vc_addingclusters-vsan-storage-archi).

##### vSAN license (BYOL only)
{: #vc_addingclusters-vsan-storage-lic}

Bring Your Own License (BYOL) is no longer supported except for migrations or upgrades of existing BYOL clusters. Use this feature only if you are upgrading or migrating an existing BYOL cluster.
{: attention}

If you are a BYOL user, provide your own vSAN license key. Select **I will provide** or **Use existing license** and enter your license key.

The **Use existing license** option is available only if you are using a BYOL vSAN license for your instance. When the option is enabled, you can select the existing license only if the instance has enough capacity for the additional hosts.

If your initial cluster is a vSAN cluster, any additional vSAN clusters use the same vSAN license and have the same configuration as the initial one. This statement is also true for any initial or extra clusters in the instance for which you select vSAN. The first time, you must provide the vSAN license and the edition. The next time that you select vSAN for a new cluster, the license you initially chose will be reused.

### Network interface settings
{: #vc_addingclusters-network-interface-settings}

When you add a cluster for an Automated instance, you must specify the following network interface settings.

#### Hostname prefix
{: #vc_addingclusters-host-name}

You can use the default hostname prefix or specify a new one. When you specify a new hostname prefix, the hostname prefix must meet the following requirements:
- Only lowercase alphabetic, numeric, and hyphen (-) characters are allowed.
- The hostname prefix must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
- The hostname prefix must end with a lowercase alphabetic or numeric character.
- The maximum length of the hostname prefix is 10 characters.

#### Configure hostnames individually
{: #vc_addingclusters-network-diagram}

You can customize the prefix for each hostname by toggling the switch on.

The hostname prefix must meet the following requirements:
* Only lowercase alphabetic, numeric, and hyphen (-) characters are allowed.
* No consecutive hyphens are allowed.
* The hostname prefix must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
* The hostname prefix must end with a lowercase alphabetic or numeric character.
* The maximum length of the hostname prefix is 13 characters.

#### Networking type
{: #vc_addingclusters-network}

Network interface card (NIC) enablement settings are based on your selection of either **Public and private network** or **Private network only**.

#### Uplink speed
{: #vc_addingclusters-uplink}

The **Uplink speed** option is not available to gateway clusters.
{: note}

{{site.data.content.uplink-speed-options-list}}

{{site.data.content.simpletable-uplink-speed-locations-ap}}

{{site.data.content.simpletable-uplink-speed-locations-eur}}

{{site.data.content.simpletable-uplink-speed-locations-naeast}}

{{site.data.content.simpletable-uplink-speed-locations-nasouth}}

#### VLANs
{: #vc_addingclusters-vlans}

Network settings are based on your selection of either **Order new VLANs** or **Select existing VLANs**.

One public VLAN and two private VLANs are required for your instance order. The two private VLANs are trunked into each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} bare metal server.

##### Order new VLANs
{: #vc_addingclusters-new-vlans}

Select to order one new public VLAN and two new private VLANs.

##### Select existing VLANs
{: #vc_addingclusters-existing-vlans}

Depending on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center that you selected, existing public and private VLANs might be available.

When you select to reuse existing public and private VLANs, specify the VLANs and subnets:
* **Public VLAN** is for public network access. If you select the **Allocate a new one** option for this field, a new public VLAN is allocated automatically. This field is only available on the **Public and private network** tab.
* **Public primary subnet** is assigned to physical hosts for public network access. If you select the **Auto assigned** option for this field, a new public primary subnet is selected automatically, and a new one is created if necessary. This field is only available on the **Public and private network** tab.
* **Private VLAN** is for connectivity among the data centers and services within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. If you select the **Allocate a new one** option for this field, a new private VLAN is allocated automatically.
* **Private primary subnet** is assigned to physical hosts for management traffic. If you select the **Auto assigned** option for this field, a new private primary subnet is selected automatically, and a new one is created if necessary.
* **Secondary private VLAN** is for VMware features such as vSAN. You can select an existing secondary private VLAN or select to allocate a new one.

Ensure that the firewall configuration on the selected VLANs does not block the management data traffic. Also, ensure that all the VLANs that you select are in the same pod. ESXi servers cannot be provisioned on mixed-pod VLANs.
{: important}

Optionally, use **Advanced settings** to configure portable subnets for VLANs.

Use the **Public VLAN**, **Private VLAN**, or **Secondary private VLAN** tabs to specify the **Portable subnet** for each applicable purpose. If you select the **Allocate a new one** option for this field, a new portable subnet is allocated automatically.
**Notes**
* Complete the **Public VLAN**, **Private VLAN**, or **Secondary private VLAN** settings before you can configure portable subnets.
* The number of portable subnets is displayed on the **Advanced settings** option after you save the portable subnet settings. Click **Portable subnets settings** to edit the settings.
* The saved portable subnet settings are cleared if you change the **Public VLAN**, **Private VLAN**, or **Secondary private VLAN** settings.

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} takes control of the entire subnet and you can't use any IP addresses in the subnet.
{: important}
