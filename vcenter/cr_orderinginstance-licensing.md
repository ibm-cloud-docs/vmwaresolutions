# Licensing
{: #cr_orderinginstance-licensing}

This topic applies only for Bring Your Own Licenses (BYOL) customers.

Specify the licensing options for the following VMware速 components in the instance:

* VMware vCenter Server速 - Standard
* VMware vSphere速 - Enterprise Plus
* VMware NSX速

Because you are bringing your own license, select **I will provide** and enter your own license key.

The default selection for NSX is Data Center SP Professional.

For Business Partner users, all licenses are included and purchased on your behalf. For users who are not Business Partners, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components by selecting **Include with purchase**. You can also Bring Your Own License by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license keys.

## Licensing notes
{: #cr_orderinginstance-licensing-notes}

* The minimum number of licenses for BYOL that are required depends on the number of CPUs per server and the number of servers in the order.
* The minimum license editions are indicated on the user interface. You are responsible for ensuring that the license key provided is correct for each VMware component selected.
* For vSphere, a license charge is incurred at the time of order, but the license charge is then credited to your account.
* You can change any licenses that you provided by using the VMware vSphere Web Client after the instance deployment is completed.
* Support for the VMware components that you provide licenses is provided by VMware, not by IBM Support.
