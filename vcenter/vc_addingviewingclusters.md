# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for vCenter Server instances

The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped as **cluster1** by default.

You can add your own clusters to VMware vCenter Server instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage ESXi servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

The delete cluster feature is available only to instances that are deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.3 and later.
{:note}

## Adding clusters to vCenter Server instances

The number of clusters that can be added to an instance depend on the instance version:
* For instances that were deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.2 and later, you can add up to 10 clusters.
* For instances that were deployed in V2.1 or earlier, you can add up to five clusters.

### System settings

When you add a cluster for a vCenter Server instance, you must specify the following settings.

#### Cluster name

The cluster name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The cluster name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum number of characters is 30.
* The cluster name must be unique within the vCenter Server instance.

#### Data center location

The {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent}} location of the cluster is set to the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} of the vCenter Server instance by default. You can deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} than the deployed instance, but you must ensure that the network latency between the two {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} is less than 150 ms. To check the network latency, you can use a tool such as [SoftLayer IP Backbone Looking Glass](http://lg.softlayer.com/).

If you deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure pod, three extra VLANs are ordered for use with the ordered {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

### Bare Metal Server settings

You can choose **Skylake**, **SAP-certified**, or **Broadwell**.

#### Skylake

For the **Skylake** setting, you have a number of options for the **CPU Model** and **RAM**. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

Table 1. Options for Skylake {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}

| CPU model options        | RAM options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4110 Processor / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | 64 GB, 96 GB, 128 GB, 192 GB, 384 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 Processor / 28 cores total, 2.2 GHz | 64 GB, 96 GB, 128 GB, 192 GB, 384 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140 Processor / 36 cores total, 2.3 GHz | 64 GB, 96 GB, 128 GB, 192 GB, 384 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |

#### SAP-certified

When you select **SAP-certified**, you cannot alter the CPU or RAM settings.

Based on your requirements, select a Bare Metal Server configuration:
* Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140 processor / 36 cores total, 2.3 GHz / 192 GB RAM
* Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140 processor / 36 cores total, 2.3 GHz / 384 GB RAM
* Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140 processor / 36 cores total, 2.3 GHz / 768 GB RAM

#### Broadwell

For the **Broadwell** setting, you have a number of options for the **CPU Model** and **RAM**. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

Table 2. Options for Broadwell {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}

| CPU model options        | RAM options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |

#### Number of Bare Metal Servers

Clusters require at least two {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

For vCenter Server instances that are deployed in V2.1 or later, you can add up to 59 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} for a cluster. You can add 1 - 59 ESXi servers at a time.

For vCenter Server instances that were deployed in V2.0 or earlier, you can add up to 32 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} for a cluster. You can add 1 - 20 ESXi servers at a time for the **Skylake**, **SAP-certified**, and **Broadwell** Bare Metal Server configuration.

After deployment, you can create up to four more clusters. If you select the **Skylake** or **Broadwell** Bare Metal Server configuration with VMware vSAN storage, four servers are required for both the initial cluster and post-deployment clusters.

### Storage settings

Storage settings are based on your selection of Bare Metal Server configuration and the storage type.

#### vSAN storage

Specify the following vSAN options:
* **Disk Type and Size for vSAN Capacity Disks**: Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.
* **Number of vSAN Capacity Disks**: Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.
* If you want to add capacity disks over the limit of eight, check the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of 10 capacity disks and is useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput. The **High-Performance Intel Optane** option is available only for Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and 6140 Processors.
* Review the **Disk Type for vSAN Cache Disks** and **Number of vSAN Cache Disks** values. These values depend on whether you checked the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box.
* **vSAN License**: Use the IBM-provided VMware license for the vSAN component by selecting **Include with purchase**, or Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license key.

If your initial cluster was a vSAN cluster, any additional vSAN clusters use the same vSAN license and have the same configuration as the initial one. This is also true if any cluster in the instance has vSAN chosen to be deployed on it (initial or additional). The first time you're prompted for the vSAN license (BYOL or purchased) and the edition. The next time that you select vSAN for a new cluster, the license that is chosen initially is reused.

#### NFS storage

When you select **NFS Storage**, you can add file-level shared storage for your instance where all shares use the same settings or you can specify different configuration settings for each file share. Specify the following NFS options:

The number of file shares must be in the range of 1 to 32.
{:note}

* **Configure shares individually**: Select to specify different configuration settings for each file share.
* **Number of Shares**: When want to use the same configuration setting for each file share, specify the number of file shares for the NFS shared storage that you want to add.
* **Size**: Select the capacity that meets your shared storage needs.
* **Performance**: Select the IOPS (input/output operations per second) per GB based on your workload requirements.
* **ADD NFS**: Select to add individual file shares with different configuration settings.

Table 3. NFS performance level options

| Option        | Details       |
  |:------------- |:------------- |
  | 2 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for most general-purpose workloads. Example applications include: hosting small databases, backing up web applications, or virtual machine disk images for a hypervisor. |
  | 4 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for higher-intensity workloads that have a high percentage of active data at a time. Example applications include: transactional databases. |
  | 10 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for the most demanding workload types, such as analytics. Example applications include: high-transaction databases and other performance-sensitive databases. This performance level is limited to a maximum capacity of 4 TB per file share. |

### Licensing settings

Specify the licensing option for the VMware vSphere component in the cluster:
* For Business Partner users, the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition) is included and purchased on your behalf.
* For non-Business Partner users, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for this component by selecting **Include with purchase**, or you can Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license key.

### Network interface settings

Network interface card (NIC) enablement settings are based on your selection of either **Public and Private Network** or **Private Network Only**. The following add-on services require public NICs and are not available if you select the private option:

* F5 on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Security Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Virtual Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}

## Deleting clusters from vCenter Server instances

You might want to delete a cluster from an instance when it's no longer needed.

### Before you delete

* Use this procedure to delete clusters from instances that are deployed in V2.3 or later.
* For clusters deployed in V2.2 or earlier instances, you must upgrade the instance to V2.3 if you want to delete the clusters that you added to the instance.
* You can delete a single cluster at a time. To delete more than one cluster, you must do it in sequence. Wait for the previous cluster to be deleted before you delete the next cluster.
* Ensure that all nodes in a cluster are powered on and operational before you delete the cluster.
* When you delete a cluster, all VMs (virtual machines) from the cluster are also deleted and they can't be recovered. If you want to keep the VMs, migrate them to other clusters.
* The default cluster can't be deleted.

### Procedure to delete clusters from vCenter Server instances

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Deployed Instances** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **vCenter Server Instances** table, click the instance that you want to delete clusters from.

   Ensure that the instance is in the **Ready to Use** status. Otherwise, you can't delete clusters from the instance.
   {:note}

3. Click **Infrastructure** on the left navigation pane. In the **CLUSTERS** table, locate the cluster that you want to delete and click the **Delete** icon in the **Actions** column.
