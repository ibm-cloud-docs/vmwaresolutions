# Network interface
{: #vc_orderinginstance-network-interface-settings}



You must specify the following network interface settings when you order a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instance.

## Hostname prefix
{: #vc_orderinginstance-host-name-prefix}

The hostname prefix applies to all clusters in the instance. It must meet the following requirements:
* Only lowercase alphabetic, numeric, and hyphen (-) characters are allowed.
* No consecutive hyphens are allowed.
* The hostname prefix must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
* The hostname prefix must end with a lowercase alphabetic or numeric character.
* The maximum length of the hostname prefix is 10 characters.

## Domain name
{: #vc_orderinginstance-domain-name}

The root domain name must meet the following requirements:
* The domain name must consist of three or more strings that are separated by a period (.) with a maximum of 50 characters.
* The first string (NetBIOS name) must start with a lowercase alphabetic character and end with a lowercase alphabetic or numeric character. It must not exceed 15 characters.
* All strings, except for the last one, can contain only lowercase alphabetic, numeric, and hyphen (-) characters.
* No consecutive hyphens are allowed.
* The last string can contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* The length of the last string must be in the range 2 - 24 characters.

The maximum length of the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for hosts and VMs is 63 characters. Domain names must accommodate for this maximum length.

## Configure hostnames individually
{: #vc_orderinginstance-network-diagram}

You can customize the prefix for each hostname by toggling the **Configure hostnames individually** switch on.

The hostname prefix must meet the following requirements:
* Only lowercase alphabetic, numeric, and hyphen (-) characters are allowed.
* No consecutive hyphens are allowed.
* The hostname prefix must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
* The hostname prefix must end with a lowercase alphabetic or numeric character.
* The maximum length of the hostname prefix is 10 characters.

## DNS configuration
{: #vc_orderinginstance-dns-config}

Select the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration for your instance:

* **Single public Windows VSI for Active Directory/DNS** - A single Microsoft® Windows® Server VSI for Microsoft® Active Directory™ (AD) is deployed and can be looked up. The VSI functions as the DNS for the instance where the hosts and VMs are registered.
* **Two highly available dedicated Windows Server VMs on the consolidated cluster** - Two Microsoft Windows® VMs are deployed, which enhances security and robustness.

You must provide two Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Standard edition licenses if you configure your instance to use two Windows Server VMs.
{: important}

Each license can be assigned only to one single physical server and covers up to two physical processors. One Standard edition license can run two virtualized Windows VMs per 2-processor server. Therefore, two licenses are required since two Windows VMs are deployed on two different hosts.

You have 30 days to activate the VMs.
