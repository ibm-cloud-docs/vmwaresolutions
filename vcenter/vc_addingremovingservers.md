# Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server instances

You can expand or contract the capacity of your VMware vCenter Server instance according to your business needs, by adding or removing ESXi servers.

If your initial cluster has vSAN as its storage, adding one or more ESXi servers after deployment can increase the cluster storage capacity.

## Before you begin

* When you remove ESXi servers, the servers are placed in maintenance mode, and after that, all the virtual machines (VMs) running on the servers are migrated before they are removed from vCenter Server. For maximum of control over the relocation of VMs, it is recommended that you place the ESXi servers to be removed in maintenance mode and migrate the VMs running on them manually using the VMware vSphere Web Client. After that, remove the ESXi servers using the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console.

   **Note:** Do not add or remove ESXi servers from the VMware vSphere Web Client. The changes that you make on the vSphere Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.

* Before you remove ESXi servers with the IBM Spectrum Protect&trade; Plus on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service installed, ensure that there are no active (failed or in progress) backup or restore operations, because these active operations might prevent the ESXi servers to be removed.
* A vCenter Server instance with NFS storage must have at least 2 ESXi servers. For instances that are deployed in V2.1 or later, you can expand the default cluster to have up to 51 ESXi servers. Each of the non-default clusters can be expanded to have up to 59 ESXi servers.

* For vCenter Server instances that were deployed in V2.0 or earlier, you can expand each cluster to have up to 32 ESXi servers. The number of {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} that you can add at a time is as follows:
   * For the **Small**, **Medium**, and **Large** configurations, you can add 1 - 10 ESXi servers at a time.
   * For the **Customized** configuration, you can add 1 - 20 ESXi servers at a time. For more information about minimum of ESXi servers, see [Is a two-node vCenter Server instance highly available?](../vmonic/faq.html#is-a-two-node-vcenter-server-instance-highly-available-)

*  A vCenter Server instance with vSAN storage must have at least 4 ESXi servers.
* The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure provides an automatic and free upgrade to your CPU model if the configuration that you order is not available. The following table identifies the possible upgrade scenarios.

Table 1. Possible CPU model upgrade options

| Ordered CPU        | Automatic CPU upgrade options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz<br><br>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz<br><br>Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4110 Processor / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz<br><br>Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 Processor / 28 cores total, 2.2 GHz |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz | Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz<br><br>Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 Processor / 28 cores total, 2.2 GHz |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz | Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 Processor / 28 cores total, 2.2 GHz |
| Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4110 Processor / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 Processor / 28 cores total, 2.2 GHz |

## Procedure

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Deployed Instances** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **vCenter Server Instances** table, click the instance for which you want to expand or contract capacity.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab.
4. Click the cluster in which you want to add ESXi servers, or from which you want to remove ESXi servers.
5. To add ESXi servers, complete the following steps:
   1. In the **ESXi Servers** section, click **Add**.
   2. In the **Add Server** window, enter the number of servers that you want to add, review the estimated cost, and then click **Add**.
6. To remove ESXi servers, select the servers that you want to remove in the **ESXi Servers** section, and then click **Remove**.

## Results

After starting the add or remove operation you might experience a slight delay in the instance status while it changes from **Ready to Use** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to fully complete before making additional changes to the instance.

You are notified by email that your request to add or remove ESXi servers is being processed. The status of the cluster associated with the ESXi servers is changed to **Modifying**. When you remove servers, note that the ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure at the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle, which is typically 30 days.

**Attention:** You are billed until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle for the removed ESXi servers.

If you do not see the new ESXi servers added to the list in the cluster, check the email or console notifications to find more details about the failure.
