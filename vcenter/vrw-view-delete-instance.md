# Viewing and deleting regulated workloads
{: #vrw-view-delete-instance}

You can view the summary and detailed information of the VMware® regulated workload that you provisioned. The available information is similar to VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see [Viewing vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewinginstances).

If you want to release the components that you ordered in a VMware regulated workload, you can delete it. The process to delete regulated workloads is similar to vCenter Server instances. For more information, see [Deleting vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletinginstance).
