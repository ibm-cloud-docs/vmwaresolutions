# Viewing and deleting VMware Regulated Workloads
{: #vrw-view-delete-instance}

You can view the summary and detailed information of the VMware® Regulated Workloads instances that you provisioned in the **Regulated workloads server instances** table on the **Resources** page. The available information is similar to that of VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see [Viewing vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewinginstances) or [Procedure to view the details of a vCenter Server multizone instance](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-mcv_viewinginstance#mcv_viewinginstance-procedure-view-inst-details).

If you want to release the components that you ordered in a VMware Regulated Workloads instance, you can delete it. The process to delete VMware Regulated Workloads instances is similar to that of vCenter Server instances. For more information, see [Deleting vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletinginstance).
