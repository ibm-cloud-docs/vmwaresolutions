You can view the summary and detailed information of the VMware® Regulated Workloads instances that you provisioned in the **Regulated workloads server instances** table on the **Resources** page. The available information is similar to that of VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see [Viewing vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewinginstances).

If you want to release the components that you ordered in a VMware Regulated Workloads instance, you can delete it. The process to delete VMware Regulated Workloads instances is similar to that of vCenter Server instances. For more information, see [Deleting vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletinginstance).
