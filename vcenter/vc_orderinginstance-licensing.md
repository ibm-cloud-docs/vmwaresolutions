{: note}

For Business Partner users, the vCenter Server license (Standard edition), the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition), and the VMware NSX® license are included and purchased on your behalf. You need to specify only the edition for the NSX license.

For users who are not Business Partners, use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components, which are included with purchase.

Bring Your Own License (BYOL) is no longer supported except for migrations or upgrades of existing BYOL clusters. Select **I will provide** and enter your own license key only if you are performing an upgrade or migration of an existing BYOL cluster.
