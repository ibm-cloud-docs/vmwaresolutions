For Business Partner users, the vCenter Server license (Standard edition), the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition), and the VMware NSX® license are included and purchased on your behalf. You need to specify only the edition for the NSX license.

For users who are not Business Partners, use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components, which are included with purchase.
