## IBM Cloud Data Center availability

Only the WDC03 - Washington, DC, POD2 {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} is available when ordering VMware Federal instances at this time.

## Services for VMware instances

VMware Federal on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} does not offer the option to order additional services at this time.

<!-- ## Capacity considerations

For capacity information and considerations, see the _Bill of
Materials_ document on the [Virtual reference architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/architecture/virtualizationArchitecture/reference-architecture) page. -->
