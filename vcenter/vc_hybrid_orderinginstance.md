# Ordering vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances
{: #vc_hybrid_orderinginstance}

To deploy a flexible and customizable VMware virtualized platform that best fits your workload needs, order a VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} with Hybridity Bundle instance. Your vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance order includes the VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) licensing and entitles you to the VMware HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. You can also add services, such as [Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services?topic=vmware-solutions-addingzertodr) for disaster recovery.

## Requirements for ordering vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances
{: #vc_hybrid_orderinginstance-req}

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
*  You configured the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [Managing user accounts and settings](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-useraccount).
*  You reviewed the information in [Requirements and planning for vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_planning).
* You reviewed the instance and domain name format. The domain name and subdomain label are used to generate the user name and server names of the instance.

Table 1. Value format for instance and domain names

| Name        | Value Format      |
  |:------------- |:------------- |
  | Domain name | `<root_domain>` |  
  | vCenter Server login user name | `<user_id>@<root_domain>` (Microsoft Active Directory user) or `administrator@vsphere.local` |
  | vCenter Server (with embedded PSC) FQDN | `vcenter-<subdomain_label>.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |
  | Single Sign-On (SSO) site name | `<subdomain_label>` |
  | Fully qualified ESXi server name | `<host_prefix><n>.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`, where `<n>` is the sequence of the ESXi server. The maximum length is 50 characters. |

Don't modify any values that are set during instance order or deployment. Doing so can make your instance unusable. For example, if public networking shuts down, if servers and Virtual Server Instances (VSIs) move behind a Vyatta mid-provision, or if the IBM CloudBuilder VSI stops or is deleted.
{:important}

* The length of the last string must be in the range 2 - 24 characters.

The maximum length of the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) for hosts and VMs (virtual machines) is 50 characters. Domain names must accommodate for this maximum length.
{:note}

### Public or private network
{: #vc_hybrid_orderinginstance-public-private-network}

Network interface card (NIC) enablement settings are based on your selection of either **Public and Private Network** or **Private Network Only**. The following add-on services require public NICs and are not available if you select the private option:

* F5 on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Security Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Virtual Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}

### Select Existing VLANs
{: #vc_hybrid_orderinginstance-existing-vlans}

Depending on the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} that you selected, existing public and private VLANs might be available.

One public VLAN and two private VLANs are required for your instance order. The two private VLANs are trunked into each Bare Metal Server.

Select **Select Existing VLANs** to reuse existing public and private VLANs and choose from the available VLANs and subnets.

* Ensure that the firewall configuration on the selected VLANs does not block the management data traffic.
* Ensure that all of the VLANs you select are in the same pod because ESXi servers cannot be provisioned on mixed-pod VLANs.
{:important}

### DNS configuration
{: #vc_hybrid_orderinginstance-dns-config}

Select the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration for your instance:

* **Single Public Windows VSI for Active Directory/DNS**: A single Microsoft Windows Server VSI for Microsoft Active Directory (AD), which functions as the DNS for the instance where the hosts and VMs are registered, is deployed and can be looked up.
* **Two highly available dedicated Windows Server VMs on the management cluster**: Two Microsoft Windows VMs are deployed, helping enhance security and robustness.

You must provide two Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 licenses if you configure your instance to use the two Microsoft Windows VMs. Use the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard edition license, or the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter edition license, or both.
{:important}

Each license can be assigned only to one single physical server and covers up to two physical processors. One Standard edition license is capable of running two virtualized Microsoft Windows VMs per 2-processor server. Therefore, two licenses are required since two Microsoft Windows VMs are deployed in two different hosts.

You have 30 days to activate the VMs.

For more information on ordering Windows licensing, see [Windows Server 2012 R2 documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/windows-server-2012-r2.aspx#tab=2).

When the instance is successfully deployed, the components that are described in [Technical specifications for vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_hybrid_overview#specs) are installed on your VMware virtual platform. The ESXi servers that you ordered are grouped as **cluster1** by default. If you ordered add-on services, the deployment of the services starts after your order is completed.

When the instance is ready to use, the status of the instance is changed to **Ready to Use** and you receive a notification by email.

When you order a secondary instance, the VMware vSphere Web Client for the primary instance (linked to the secondary one) might be restarted after your secondary instance order is completed.

## What to do next
{: #vc_hybrid_orderinginstance-next}

View and manage the vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance that you ordered.

You must manage the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components that are created in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account	 only from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, not the 	{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, or any other means outside of the console.
If you change these components outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, the changes are not synchronized with the console.
{:important}

**CAUTION:** Managing any {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components (which were installed into your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account	 when you ordered the instance) from outside the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console can make your environment unstable. These management activities include:
*  Adding, modifying, returning, or removing components
*  Expanding or contracting instance capacity through adding or removing ESXi servers
*  Powering off components
*  Restarting services

   Exceptions to these activities include managing the shared storage file shares from the 	{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Such activities include: ordering, deleting (which might impact data stores if mounted), authorizing, and mounting shared storage file shares.
