# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for VMware Federal instances

The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped as **cluster1** by default.

You can add clusters to your VMware Federal instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage ESXi servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, you can delete the added clusters from your instances.

**Availability:** The adding and deleting clusters feature is available only to instances that were deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.3 and later releases.

## Adding clusters to VMware Federal instances

You can add up to 10 clusters to an instance. When you add a cluster for a VMware Federal instance, you must specify the following settings.

### System settings

When you add a cluster for a VMware Federal instance, you must specify the following settings.

#### Cluster name

The cluster name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The cluster name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length of the cluster name is 30 characters.
* The cluster name must be unique within the VMware Federal instance.

#### Data center location

The data center of the cluster is set to the data center of the VMware Federal instance by default.

### Bare Metal Server settings

#### Skylake

Specify the CPU model and RAM for the Bare Metal Server. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

Table 1. Options for Skylake {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}

| CPU model options        | RAM options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4110 Processor / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | 64 GB, 96 GB, 128 GB, 192 GB, 384 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 Processor / 28 cores total, 2.2 GHz | 64 GB, 96 GB, 128 GB, 192 GB, 384 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140 Processor / 36 cores total, 2.3 GHz | 64 GB, 96 GB, 128 GB, 192 GB, 384 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |

#### Broadwell

Specify the CPU model and RAM for the Bare Metal Server. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

Table 2. Options for Broadwell {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}

| CPU model options        | RAM options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |

#### Number of Bare Metal Servers

A minimum of 2 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} is required for a cluster.

For VMware Federal instances that are deployed in V2.3 or later, you can add up to 59 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} for a cluster, and you can add 1 - 59 ESXi servers at a time.

After deployment, you can create up to four more clusters. For vSAN storage settings, four servers are required for both the initial cluster and post-deployment clusters.

### Storage settings

Storage settings are based on your selection of Bare Metal Server configuration and the storage type.

#### vSAN storage

Specify the following vSAN options:
* **Disk Type and Size for vSAN Capacity Disks**: Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.
* **Number of vSAN Capacity Disks**: Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.
* If you want to add capacity disks over the limit of eight, check the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of 10 capacity disks and is useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput. The **High-Performance Intel Optane** option is available only for Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and 6140 Processors.
* Review the **Disk Type for vSAN Cache Disks** and **Number of vSAN Cache Disks** values. These values depend on whether you checked the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box.
* **vSAN License**: Select the VMware vSAN 6.6 license edition (Advanced or Enterprise).

If your initial cluster was added as a vSAN cluster, any additional vSAN clusters use the same vSAN license and the same configuration as the initial vSAN cluster. This is also true if any cluster in the instance has vSAN chosen to be deployed on it (initial or additional). The first time that you add a cluster, you are prompted for the vSAN license and the edition. The next time that you select vSAN for a new cluster, whatever you chose initially is reused.

#### NFS storage

When you select **NFS Storage**, you can add file-level shared storage for your instance where all shares use the same settings or you can specify different configuration settings for each file share. Specify the following NFS options:

The number of file shares must be in the range of 1 to 32.
{:note}

* **Configure shares individually**: Select to specify different configuration settings for each file share.
* **Number of Shares**: When using the same configuration setting for each file share, specify the number of file shares for the NFS shared storage that you want to add.
* **Size**: Select the capacity that meets your shared storage needs.
* **Performance**: Select the IOPS (Input/output Operations Per Second) per GB based on your workload requirements.
* **ADD NFS**: Select to add individual file shares with different configuration settings.

Table 3. NFS performance level options

| Option        | Details       |
  |:------------- |:------------- |
  | 2 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for most general-purpose workloads. Example applications include: hosting small databases, backing up web applications, or virtual machine disk images for a hypervisor. |
  | 4 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for higher-intensity workloads that have a high percentage of active data at a time. Example applications include: transactional databases. |
  | 10 IOPS/GB | This option is designed for the most demanding workload types, such as analytics. Example applications include: high-transaction databases and other performance-sensitive databases. This performance level is limited to a maximum capacity of 4 TB per file share.|

## Deleting clusters from VMware Federal instances

You might want to delete a cluster from an instance when it is no longer needed.

Use this procedure to remove clusters from instances that are deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.3 and later releases.
{:note}

### Before you delete

* Use this procedure to delete clusters from instances that are deployed in V2.3 or later releases.
* For clusters deployed in V2.2 or earlier instances, you must upgrade the instance to V2.3 to be able to delete the clusters that you added to the instance.
* You can delete a single cluster at a time. To delete multiple clusters, you must do it in sequence; waiting for the previous cluster to be deleted before you attempt to delete the next cluster.
* Ensure that all nodes in a cluster are powered on and operational before you delete the cluster.
* When you delete a cluster, all VMs (virtual machines) from the cluster are also deleted and they cannot be recovered. If you want to keep the VMs, migrate them to other clusters.
* The default cluster cannot be deleted.

## Procedure to delete clusters from VMware Federal instances

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Deployed Instances** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **vCenter Server Instances** table, click the instance that you want to delete clusters from.
