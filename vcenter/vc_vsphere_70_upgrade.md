# Upgrading vCenter Server vSphere software from vSphere 6.5 or 6.7 to 7.0
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade}

The {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} offering is a fully automated deployment solution for the VMware vSphere® SDDC stack. It includes vSphere, VMware NSX®, and optionally vSAN™ products. While the offering automates the most challenging parts of deploying, expanding, and contracting a VMware® SDDC-based infrastructure, it is not a managed service.

It has a policy of supporting the automation of VMware® SDDC software versions within the range of n-1. If you want to continue to benefit from the VMware Solutions automation, you must use the most recent version of vCenter Server.

Adding and removing services is not supported for instances that are upgraded to vSphere 7. Due to this limitation and the architecture improvements, {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} suggests that you deploy a new vSphere 7 instance and migrate your current network topology and workloads to the new instance.
{: important}

If your instance is at a version earlier than the version level that is needed for automation support, it continues to be supported as required by the Broadcom Support policy. However, your instance might not function with the current {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} automation.

You must apply patches and upgrade the VMware software periodically, over the lifecycle of an instance. This maintenance includes upgrading the VMware SDDC software to a version that is supported by the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} automation.

The following procedure provides the steps that are required to convert a VMware vSphere 6.5 or 6.7-based instance to a VMware vSphere 7 based instance.

## Important considerations
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-considerations}

* You are responsible to ensure that all VMware ESXi™ servers have proper firmware and drivers to support vSphere 7. Broadwell and Skylake servers are not supported. Research and plan carefully for Cascade Lake servers.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports only Cascade Lake bare metal servers for newly deployed vSphere 7 instances.
* If you add clusters or hosts to a vSphere 7 instance in the VMware Solutions console, only Cascade Lake bare metal servers are provisioned.
* After you upgrade, your existing clusters will continue to use N-VDS switches, which are deprecated by VMware. Support for N-VDS (NSX-T Virtual Distributed Switch) will be removed in a future VMware NSX-T™ release. Plan to migrate your workloads to a new {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instance with vSphere 7. For more information, see [NSX-V to NSX-T migration overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-v2t-overview).
* If you are using VMware NSX-V, familiarize yourself with the product lifecycle for NSX-V from VMware and plan to migrate your workloads to a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} instance. For more information, see [NSX-V to NSX-T migration overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-v2t-overview).
* {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} is designed to allow for a "rolling" upgrade. That is, virtual machine (VM) workloads that are currently functioning continue to function without an outage if you complete the following procedure. Enterprises must engage their change management policies to enable a structured and communicated upgrade and plan for contingencies. However, during the upgrade process of certain management functions, such as vCenter Server and NSX Manager, temporary outages of management functions, configuration changes, powering off and on VMs, might be impacted.

## Before you begin
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-prereq}

The time to complete the upgrade is unknown. It is possible that it might take several maintenance windows to completely upgrade an environment. Running up-leveled and down-leveled versions of the SDDC software is supported by VMware during the upgrade process. However, some functions such as vMotion, might be limited during this process.

Complete the following requirements before you begin the upgrade:
* Upgrade any extensions or snap-ins within the environment. Review the following documentation before you plan your upgrade:
   * [VMware vSphere 7.0 release notes](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/release-notes/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-70-release-notes.html){: external}
   * [About VMware ESXi upgrade](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/esxi-upgrade-7-0.html){: external}
* Set up vSphere Update Manager (VUM) within your Automated instance to download updates from VMware vSphere. For more information, see [VMware Update Manager introduction](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vum-intro#vum-intro).
* Open a support ticket with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} team to notify them that an upgrade is being planned. The ticket remains open until the instance is registered at the upgraded level in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
* Confirm whether the instance that you are upgrading is linked to another instance as primary or secondary in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console. All linked instances must have their Platform Services Controllers (PSCs) upgraded first as part of a particular site upgrade.
* Confirm the following requirements for vSAN based instances:
   * Ensure that the vSAN Health tool is enabled and reports no critical errors. If critical errors are present, contact the IBM Support team with the upgrade support ticket ID.
   * Ensure that each node has space to handle rebuilding redundancy of vSAN objects in case an ESXi host fails to come back up during the upgrade. You might need to either reduce disk usage or add an ESXi host before the upgrade.
   * Verify whether the overall vSAN volume usage is higher than 70%. You might need to either reduce disk usage or add an ESXi host before the upgrade.
* Verify that the vCenter Server root user ID with its credentials are visible on the console. If your instance was initially ordered in a VMware Solutions version between V2.5 and V5.7, only the `customerroot` account is visible on the console. For new instances, clusters, hosts, and VMs ordered in VMware Solutions V5.7 and later, the `customerroot` user is no longer created by the VMware Solutions automation.
* Confirm that you have a [My VMware](https://support.broadcom.com/){: external} user ID for which to download the required binary files to upgrade. If you don't have a user ID, [contact IBM Support](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_support) with the upgrade support ticket ID.
* Confirm that VUM is configured to reach https://www.vmware.com to download patches. If it can't be configured because of security policies, then you must manually download the most recent patch sets and upload them into VUM. For more information, see [VMware Update Manager introduction](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vum-intro#vum-intro).

### Preparing your jump server
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-prereq-jumpbox}

Because the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} client access VPN is limited to 512 Kbps, take one of the following actions.
* Provision an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Windows® 2012-2016 server Virtual Server Instance (VSI).
* Set up a similar Windows® VM on a separate {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto-short}} environment within the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center.
   The Windows VM is used as a jump server into the new instance for the upgrade that downloads the binary files from `https://my.vmware.com`. Do not place this VM on the old instance that is being upgraded.

Complete the following steps to download the most recent files to your jump server:
1. From the VMware portal, download the following product files onto your jump server:
   * For VMware vCenter Server Appliance, `VMware-VCSA-all-7.0.x-xxxx.iso`
   * For ESXi 7, `VMware-ESXi-7.0Ux-xxxx-depot.zip`
   * For Hypervisor, `VMware-VMvisor-Installer-7.0Ux-xxxx.x86_64.iso`
2. Download the most recent STOR_CLI, for example, `007.xxx.0000.0000_Unified_StorCLI_PUL.zip` file from `https://docs.broadcom.com/`.

## Procedure to upgrade vCenter Server vSphere software from 6.5 or 6.7 to 7.0
{: #vc_vsphere_70-upgrade-procedure}

You can also upgrade vCenter Server to version 8.0. For more information, see [Upgrading to vCenter Server 8.0](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_vcs_80_upgrade).

### Before you begin
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-procedure-before}

* If you encounter a problem during the upgrade process, use the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} upgrade ticket that you opened at the beginning of the process to [contact IBM Support](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_support). If required, IBM Support will open tickets with Broadcom Support.
* You must follow the support process to ensure that {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} provides Broadcom Support with all the information about the vCenter Server design and setup, and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} information.
* By following the support process, you ensure that accurate information is shared with Broadcom Support, which shortens the support experience. After IBM Support provides the necessary information to Broadcom Support, you can interact with Broadcom Support directly.
* Ensure that you keep a record of all the new passwords and credentials that you create as part of the upgrade process. IBM Support requires these credentials at the end of the upgrade process to update their internal database.

### Procedure to set the cluster Distributed Resource Schedule to manual

   4. For **Connection Settings**, keep the **VM Network** and **VLAN ID None** defaults. Click **Next**, then **Finish**. *Standard Switch: vSwitch0* is displayed in the list of switches.
5. Make a note of the Network Setting for the vCenter Server Appliance VM. You must update the new vCenter appliance to match.
   * From the vCenter Server user interface, click the VM for the vCenter appliance. Note the name, ending with ``vc``.
   * From the middle pane, click the **Networks** tab. Note the name of the distributed port group, ending with ``-dpg-mgmt``. 

### Procedure to upgrade vCenter Server
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-procedure-vcenter}

Follow the VMware instructions for upgrading vCenter. For more information, see [Upgrade a vCenter Server Appliance 6.5 or 6.7 with an embedded Platform Services Controller by using the GUI](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/vcenter-server-upgrade-7-0/upgrading-and-updating-the-vcenter-server-appliance/gui-upgrade-of-the-vcsa-and-psc-appliance/upgrade-the-vmware-vcenter-server-appliance-with-embedded-sso.html){: external}.

Ensure to complete the following requirements during the upgrade:

* Mount the VMware-VCSA ISO, go to the `visa-ui-installer\win32` directory, and run the installer.
* In the vCenter Server installer dialog, select the **Upgrade** flow and complete the steps in the installer.
* You must use the IP and credentials (administrator and root) for the current vCenter Server appliance. Use the IP and root password for the ESXi host of the current vCenter Server Appliance and the host where you want to deploy the new 7.0 or later vCenter Server Appliance. You must use a new temporary IP address, gateway, and subnet mask for the new vCenter Server Appliance during installation.
* Complete Stage 2 when prompted. Ensure to note any warnings and take the appropriate actions.

### Procedure to upgrade Stor VIB (Broadcom driver)
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-procedure-broadcom}

You must upgrade the Broadcom driver before you upgrade the ESXi host.

1. Extract the ``007.xxx.0000.0000_Unified_StorCLI_PUL.zip`` file to a directory on your windows jump server.
2. Locate the ``vmware-storcli.vib`` file in the extracted file contents.
3. Copy the ``.vib`` file to either a vSAN or NFS data store that is mounted on the ESXi hosts for the instance. Use vCenter Server to reference the extracted file on your jump server.
4. SSH into each ESXi host and run the following VIB Upgrade command:
   ``esxcli software vib update -v /<path to vsan or nfs datastore from step 3>/vmware-storcli.vib --no-sig-check``
   The following installation results are displayed.
    ``Message: Operation finished successfully.    Reboot Required: false    VIBs Installed: Broadcom_bootbank_vmware-storcli_007.xxx.0000.0000-01    VIBs Removed: LSI_bootbank_vmware-storcli_007.xxx.0000.0000-01    VIBs Skipped:``
5. Run the following command to validate the installation:
   ``> esxcli software vib list |grep vmware-storcli
   vmware-storcli    007.xxx.0000.0000-01    Broadcom  PartnerSupported  yyyy-mm-dd``
6. Repeat for each host.

### Procedure to upgrade the ESXi hosts
{: #vc_vsphere_70_upgrade-procedure-esxi-upgrade}

1. From the vCenter Server user interface, go to **LCM menu > LifeCycle Manager**.
2. Select **IMPORT ISO > IMPORT ISO**, and then the ``VMware-VMvisor-Installer-7.0U1c-17325551.iso`` file.
3. Create the baseline. Select **BASELINE > CREATE** and use the imported ISO from the previous step.
4. For each host, choose the host in the vCenter browser tree. Then, select **update** (located in the far left in the main window).
5. If the Zerto VRA is present on the host, put the host into maintenance mode first. Recent releases of Zerto stop the VRA, which otherwise would prevent the update.
6. Complete the update.
   1. [ATTACH] Baseline, select the previously created baseline.
   2. Select Baseline and [REMEDIATE].
7. Remediate each host in turn. After remediation, ensure to pull the host out of maintenance mode.

If the upgrade process fails immediately and the ``host cannot enter maintenance mode`` error message is displayed, shut down the Zerto ZVAs and try again. The ZVRA VMs automatically start as each server comes out of remediation. For more information about continuing Zerto replication during the upgrade process, see [How to Place a Host with an Associated VRA into Maintenance Mode](https://www.zerto.com/myzerto/knowledge-base/how-to-place-a-host-with-an-associated-vra-into-maintenance-mode/){: external}.
