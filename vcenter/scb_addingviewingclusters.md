# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances
{: #scb_addingviewingclusters}

You can add your own clusters to Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage VMware ESXi™ servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

The procedures to add, view, and delete clusters for Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances are similar to those of VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see the following topics:
