# Removing the Hybridity Bundle from a vCenter Server instance
{: #vc_hybrid_deletingbundle}

To remove the Hybridity Bundle license from your vCenter Server instance, you must replace the VMware NSX and VMware vSAN rental license keys with Bring Your Own License (BYOL) keys in the VMware vSphere Web Client. Additionally, you must open a support ticket to cancel charges for the rental licenses.

Downgrading your license might cause your vCenter Server instance to fail. You can choose to downgrade a license at your own risk, but first consider the functions that are not available when you downgrade. For more information, see [Comparison chart for VMware component editions](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/archiref/solution?topic=vmware-solutions-solution-appendix).

## Important considerations before you remove the Hybridity Bundle from a multi-site environment
{: #vc_hybrid_deletingbundle-considerations}

Review the following considerations before you remove the Hybridity Bundle from a multi-site environment:

* You must apply BYOL licenses to all multi-site deployments before you remove rental licenses.
* You must combine VMware NSX licenses and have enough capacity to use across all multi-site deployments.
* You must create a single support ticket to remove the Hybridity Bundle from all multi-site deployments.

While removing the Hybridity Bundle from a multi-site environment, BYOL licenses are applied. It is your responsibility to ensure that the license editions are consistent across all sites in the multi-site configuration.

## Before you remove the Hybridity Bundle
{: #vc_hybrid_deletingbundle-prereq}

Verify the following requirements before you remove the Hybridity Bundle:

* You have a V2.4 or later vCenter Server instance with the Hybridity Bundle enabled.
* You do not have the VMware HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service installed on your vCenter Server instance.
* You have access to the VMware vSphere Web Client as Administrator.
* If not already applied, you have BYOL keys available to apply for VMware NSX and each VMware vSAN cluster.
* Optionally and if not already applied, you have BYOL keys available to apply for the VMware vCenter Server and VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus licenses.
