# Deleting VMware Federal instances

To release the components that you ordered in a VMware Federal instance, delete the instance.

When you delete a VMware Federal instance, the following components are released sequentially:

1. Support and service fees
2. VMware product licenses
3. ESXi servers
4. Subnets

Because of resource dependencies, the components in your instance are not released immediately when you delete the instance. For example, the subnets cannot be deleted until the ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure, which happens at the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle. At the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle, which is typically 30 days, the subnets are deleted and the instance deletion is completed.

You are billed until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle for the deleted instance.
