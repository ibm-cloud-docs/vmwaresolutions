# Licensing
{: #vrw-orderinginstance-licensing}

Specify the licensing options for the following VMware® components in the instance:
* VMware vCenter Server® Standard 7.0
* VMware vSphere® Enterprise Plus 7.0
* VMware NSX-T™ 3.1.1 Enterprise edition (Data Center SP Advanced or Data Center SP Enterprise Plus)
* (Multizone VMware instance only) VMware vSAN™ Enterprise license

The VMware HCX™ service is not available for Data Center SP Enterprise Plus.

Small differences exist between NSX-T Data Center and Data Center SP editions. For more information, see [Product offerings for VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.x (80866)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80866){: external}.
{: note}

For Business Partner users, all licenses are included and purchased on your behalf. For users who are not Business Partners, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components by selecting **Include with purchase**. You can also Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license keys.

## Licensing notes
{: #vrw-orderinginstance-licensing-notes}

* The minimum number of licenses for BYOL that are required depends on the number of CPUs per server and the number of servers in the order.
* The minimum license editions are indicated on the user interface. You are responsible to ensure that the license key provided is correct for each VMware component selected.
* For vSphere, a license charge is incurred at the time of order, but the license charge is then credited to your account.
* You can change any licenses that you provided by using the VMware vSphere Web Client after the instance deployment is completed.
* Support for the VMware components that you provide licenses is provided by VMware, not by IBM Support.
