# Deleting clusters from Automated instances
{: #vc_deletingclusters}

Deleting clusters from instances with VMware vSphereÂ® 6.5 is not supported.
{: note}

## Before you delete clusters from Automated instances
{: #vc_deletingclusters-before}

{{site.data.content.para-vcenterremoveclusters}}

* You can delete any cluster except for the first cluster (the one that is created during initial deployment).
* You can delete multiple clusters at a time. You can also delete a cluster while another cluster is being created or deleted.
* Ensure that all nodes in a cluster are powered on and operational before you delete the cluster.
* When you delete a cluster, all VMs from the cluster are also deleted and they can't be recovered. If you want to keep the VMs, migrate them to other clusters.
* When you delete a cluster, all storage and subnets that are associated with the cluster are deleted as well. To view the storage and subnets that are associated with a cluster, see the cluster details page.
* You do not have to delete any services that are installed on the cluster, including services on a gateway cluster. The services are automatically deleted when you delete the cluster.
