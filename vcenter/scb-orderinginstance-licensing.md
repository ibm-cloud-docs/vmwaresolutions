# Licensing
{: #scb-orderinginstance-licensing}

Specify the licensing options for the following VMware速 components in the instance:
* VMware vCenter Server速 Standard 7.0
* VMware vSphere速 Enterprise Plus 7.0
* VMware NSX-T 3.1.1 (Data Center SP Professional, Data Center SP Advanced, or Data Center SP Enterprise Plus)

The VMware HCX service is not available for Data Center SP Enterprise Plus.

Small differences exist between NSX-T速 Data Center and Data Center SP editions. For more information, see [Product offerings for VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.x (80866)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80866){: external}.
{: note}

For Business Partner users, all licenses are included and purchased on your behalf. For users who are not Business Partners, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components by selecting **Include with purchase**, or you can Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license keys.

## Licensing notes
{: #scb-orderinginstance-licensing-notes}

* The minimum number of licenses for BYOL that are required depends on the number of CPUs per server and the number of servers in the order.
* The minimum license editions are indicated on the user interface. You are responsible to ensure that the license key provided is correct for each VMware component selected.
* For vSphere, a license charge is incurred at the time of order, but the license charge is then credited to your account.
* You can change any licenses that you provided by using the VMware vSphere Web Client after the instance deployment is completed.
* Support for the VMware components that you provide licenses is provided by VMware, not by IBM Support.
