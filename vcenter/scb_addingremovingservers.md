{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

New deployments of Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances are no longer supported. You can still add or delete clusters, add or delete VMware ESXi™ servers or NFS storage, and add or remove services for existing instances. You can also view and delete your Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances.
{: deprecated}

Expand or contract the capacity of your Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instance according to your business needs, by adding or deleting VMware ESXi servers or Network File System (NFS) storage.

The procedures to add or delete servers and storage for Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances are similar to procedures for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-auto}} instances. For more information, see the following topics:
