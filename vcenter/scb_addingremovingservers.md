# Expanding and contracting capacity for Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances
{: #scb_addingremovingservers}

Expand or contract the capacity of your Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instance according to your business needs, by adding or removing VMware ESXi™ servers or Network File System (NFS) storage.

The process to add and delete servers for Security and Compliance Readiness Bundle instances is similar to that of VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingremovingservers).
