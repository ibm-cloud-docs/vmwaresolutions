# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters}

The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped as **cluster1** by default.

You can add clusters to your VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} with Hybridity Bundle instance to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, manage the ESXi servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instance.

## Adding clusters to vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding}

The number of clusters that can be added to an instance depends on the instance version:
* For instances that were deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.5 and later, the number of clusters, hosts, and VMs determines the maximum limit for the number of clusters you can add. You must remain within the VMware sizing guidelines and limits for your deployment.
* For instances that were deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.3 and later, you can add up to 10 clusters.

For more information about maximum limits, see [VMware Configuration Maximums](https://configmax.vmware.com/home){:new_window}.

### System settings
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding-sys-settings}

When you add a cluster for a vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance, you must specify the following settings.

#### Cluster name
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding-cluster-name}

The cluster name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The cluster name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length of the cluster name is 30 characters.
* The cluster name must be unique within the vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance.

#### Data center location
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding-dc-location}

The {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} location of the cluster is set to the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} of the vCenter Server instance by default. You can deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} than the deployed instance, but you must ensure that the network latency between the two {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} is less than 150 ms. To check the network latency, use a tool such as [SoftLayer IP Backbone Looking Glass](http://lg.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.

If you deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure pod, three more VLANs are ordered for use with the ordered {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

### Bare Metal Server settings
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding-bare-metal}

Specify the CPU model and RAM for the Bare Metal Server. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

#### Number of Bare Metal Servers
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding-bare-metal-number}

At least two {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} is required for a cluster.

You can add up to 59 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} for a cluster, and you can add 1 - 59 ESXi servers at a time.

After deployment, you can create up to four more clusters. For VMware vSAN storage, four servers are required for both the initial cluster and post-deployment clusters.

### vSAN storage settings
{: #vc_hybrid_addingviewingclusters-adding-vsan-storage-settings}

VMware vSAN 6.6 is included with your vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance order. Specify the following vSAN options:
* **Disk Type and Size for vSAN Capacity Disks**: Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.
* **Number of vSAN Capacity Disks**: Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.
* If you want to add capacity disks over the limit of eight, check the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of 10 capacity disks and is useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput.

  The **High-Performance Intel Optane** option is available only for the Skylake CPU models Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140.
