# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances

The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped as **cluster1** by default.

You can add clusters to your VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} with Hybridity Bundle instance to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, manage the ESXi servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instance.

## Adding clusters to vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instances

You can add up to 10 clusters to your vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance.

### System settings

When you add a cluster for a vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance, you must specify the following settings.

#### Cluster name

The cluster name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The cluster name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length of the cluster name is 30 characters.
* The cluster name must be unique within the vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance.

#### Data center location

The {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} location of the cluster is set to the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} of the vCenter Server instance by default. You can deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} than the deployed instance, but you must ensure that the network latency between the two {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} is less than 150 ms. To check the network latency, use a tool such as [SoftLayer IP Backbone Looking Glass](http://lg.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.

If you deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure pod, three more VLANs are ordered for use with the ordered {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

### Bare Metal Server settings

Specify the CPU model and RAM for the Bare Metal Server. Available options might differ depending on the version that your instance was initially deployed in.

#### Skylake

When you select **Skylake**, you can choose the CPU and RAM combination according to your needs.

Table 1. Options for Skylake Bare Metal Servers

| CPU model options        | RAM options       |

| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |

#### Number of Bare Metal Servers

At least two {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} is required for a cluster.

You can add up to 59 {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} for a cluster, and you can add 1 - 59 ESXi servers at a time.

After deployment, you can create up to four more clusters. For VMware vSAN storage, four servers are required for both the initial cluster and post-deployment clusters.

### vSAN storage settings

VMware vSAN 6.6 is included with your vCenter Server with Hybridity Bundle instance order. Specify the following vSAN options:
* **Disk Type and Size for vSAN Capacity Disks**: Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.
* **Number of vSAN Capacity Disks**: Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.
* If you want to add capacity disks over the limit of eight, check the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of 10 capacity disks and is useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput. The **High-Performance Intel Optane** option is available only for Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and 6140 Processors.
* Review the **Disk Type for vSAN Cache Disks** and **Number of vSAN Cache Disks** values. These values depend on whether you checked the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box.
* **vSAN License**: Select the VMware vSAN 6.6 license edition (Advanced or Enterprise).

### Licensing settings

IBM-provided licenses for the following VMware components:
  * vSphere Enterprise Plus 6.5u1
  * vCenter Server 6.5
  * NSX Service Providers 6.4 (Advanced or Enterprise edition)

### Network interface settings

Network interface card (NIC) settings are based on your selection of either **Public and Private Network** or **Private Network Only**. The following add-on services require public NICs and aren't available with the private option:

* F5 on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Security Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Virtual Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
