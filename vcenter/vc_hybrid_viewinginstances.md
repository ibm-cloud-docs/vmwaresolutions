## What to do next
{: #vc_hybrid_viewinginstances-next}

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console or the VMware vSphere Web Client.

Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance summary page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing your ESXi servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}}. Hover over the **vCenter console** button and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.

Review the following topics for information to help you complete the login instructions:
*  For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to the vSphere Web Client](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_timeout_vc_console).
*  For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure Private Network using VPN, see [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access){:new_window}.
*  If you have problems when you deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file using the vSphere Web Client, see [Deploying an OVF file using the vSphere Web Client](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_deploy_ovf).
