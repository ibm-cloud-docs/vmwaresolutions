If errors occur during instance deployment or instance deletion, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support team is automatically notified. To inquire about the status of your ticket, follow the steps in [Contacting IBM Support](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-trbl_support).

## What to do next
{: #vc_hybrid_viewinginstances-next}

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console or the VMware vSphere Web Client.

Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance summary page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing your VMware ESXi™ servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. Hover over the **vCenter console** button and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.
