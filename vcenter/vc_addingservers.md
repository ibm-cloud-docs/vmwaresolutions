# Adding ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_addingservers}

You can expand the capacity of your VMware® vCenter Server® instance according to your business needs by adding VMware ESXi™ servers.

## Before you add ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_addingservers-prereq}

* Adding ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances with VMware vSphere® 6.5 is not supported.
* For the edge services cluster, you cannot add or remove ESXi servers.
* For existing instances with vSphere 6.7u1, you can add ESXi servers with either vSphere 6.7u1 or vSphere 6.7u3.
* Whenever possible, add ESXi servers by using the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console because changes that you make on the VMware vSphere Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console. Therefore, add ESXi servers to vCenter Server only for on-premises ESXi servers or ESXi servers that you won't manage in the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
* A vCenter Server instance with NFS storage must have at least three ESXi servers (for NSX-T™) or two ESXi servers (for NSX-V™). Each of the non-default clusters can be expanded to have up to 59 ESXi servers.
* A vCenter Server instance with vSAN™ storage must have at least four ESXi servers.
* If your initial cluster has vSAN storage, adding one or more ESXi servers after deployment can increase the cluster storage capacity.
* If your initial cluster has vSAN storage, SED SSD disks are no longer available. Non-SED SSD disks are ordered.
* You can add 1 - 20 ESXi servers at a time. For more information about the minimum of ESXi servers, see [Is a two-node vCenter Server instance highly available?](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-faq-vmwaresolutions#is-a-two-node-vcenter-server-instance-highly-available)

## Procedure to add ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_addingservers-procedure}
{: help}
{: support}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Resources** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **vCenter Server instances** table, click the instance for which you want to expand capacity.
3. Click **Infrastructure** on the left navigation pane.
4. In the **Clusters** table, click the cluster to which you want to add ESXi servers.
5. In the **ESXi servers** section, click **Add**.
6. On the **ESXi server** page, select the number of bare metal servers that you want to add.
7. For vSphere 7.0, optionally select to change the bare metal server configuration. Then, select the VMware vSphere version.
8. Optionally, select the **Maintenance mode** checkbox to add servers during maintenance mode. The checkbox is selected by default.

   When you provision the new ESXi server, virtual machines (VMs) are immediately migrated to the new servers if you do not select the **Maintenance mode** checkbox. You do not receive a confirmation message before the migration begins.
   {: important}

9. Complete the bare metal server configuration.
   * Select an existing bare metal server configuration that is being used by the existing ESXi servers in the cluster. This option is not available under the following conditions:
      * The bare metal configuration used by the existing ESXi servers in the cluster is **Broadwell**.
      * The storage type of the cluster is **Local disks**.
   * Select a new bare metal server configuration:
      * (NSX-V only) For instances with vSphere Enterprise Plus 6.7u1, specify the VMware vSphere version for the new ESXi server.
      * For **Skylake** and **Cascade Lake**, specify the **CPU model**, the amount of **RAM**, and the **Number of bare metal servers**.
      * For **SAP-certified**, specify the **CPU model and RAM** and the **Number of bare metal servers**.
10. Complete the subnet settings.
    * Select to continue to use the previously selected primary subnets.
    * Select to specify primary subnets. Then, use the lists to select the **Public primary subnet** and **Private primary subnet**.
11. Complete the storage configuration. Specify the disk types for the capacity and cache disks, the number of disks, and the vSAN license edition. If you want more storage, select the **High performance Intel Optane** checkbox.
12. On the **Summary** pane, review the estimated pricing and click **Create**.

   You can also add the provisioned resources to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} estimate tool, by clicking **Add to estimate**. This is useful if you want to estimate the price of the selected {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} resources together with other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you might consider to purchase.

## Results after you add ESXi servers to vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_addingservers-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console while the instance status changes from **Ready to use** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to complete before you make more changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email that your request to add ESXi servers is being processed. On the console, the status of the cluster that is associated with the ESXi servers is changed to **Modifying**.
3. If you do not see the new ESXi servers added to the list in the cluster, check the email or console notifications to find more details about the failure.
4. (NSX-V only) You must use the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) console and the pre-populated Zerto Virtual Replication Appliance (VRA) IP address to manually deploy the VRA virtual machine in the following circumstances:
   * If you add ESXi servers to a default cluster while the servers are in maintenance mode and Zerto for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is installed.
   * If you add Zerto for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to a vCenter Server instance that has an ESXi server that is in maintenance mode.

If you are adding ESXi servers during maintenance mode, VMs are not migrated to the new servers until you remove maintenance mode.
