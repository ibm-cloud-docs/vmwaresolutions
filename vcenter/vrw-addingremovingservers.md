# Expanding and contracting capacity for VMware Regulated Workloads
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers}

Expand or contract the capacity of your VMware® Regulated Workloads instances according to your business needs, by adding or removing VMware vSphere® ESXi™ servers or Network File System (NFS) storage.

## Before you add or delete ESXi servers
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers-before}

You must migrate the VMware vCenter Server® virtual machines (VMs) before you delete a server. This requirement applies to the vCenter Server VM and to the additional VCHA VMs on the management and witness clusters.

## Adding or deleting ESXi servers
{: #vrw-addingremovingservers-add-delete}

The process to add and delete servers for VMware Regulated Workloads instances is similar to that of vCenter Server instances. For more information, see [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingremovingservers) or [Expanding and contracting capacity for vCenter Server multizone instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-mcv_addingremovingservers).
