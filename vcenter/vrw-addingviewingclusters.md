# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for VMware Regulated Workloads
{: #vrw-addingviewingclusters}

You can add your own clusters to VMware® Regulated Workloads instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage VMware vSphere® ESXi™ servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, delete the added clusters from your instances.

The procedures to add, view, and delete clusters for VMware Regulated Workloads instances are similar to those of VMware vCenter Server® instances. For more information, see the following topics:
* [Adding clusters to vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingclusters)
* [Viewing clusters in vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_viewingclusters)
* [Deleting clusters from vCenter Server instances](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_deletingclusters)
