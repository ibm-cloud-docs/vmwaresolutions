# Ordering vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_orderinginstance}

To deploy a flexible and customizable VMware virtualized platform that best fits your workload needs, order a VMware vCenter Server instance. During the initial order, you can also add services, such as [Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services?topic=vmware-solutions-addingzertodr) for disaster recovery.

## Requirements
{: #vc_orderinginstance-req}

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
* You configured the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [Managing user accounts and settings](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-useraccount).
* You reviewed the information in [Requirements and planning for vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_planning).
* You reviewed the instance and domain name format. The domain name and subdomain label are used to generate the user name and server names of the instance.

Table 1. Value format for instance and domain names

| Name        | Value Format      |
  |:------------|:------------ |
  | Domain name | `<root_domain>` |  
  | vCenter Server login user name | `<user_id>@<root_domain>` (Microsoft Active Directory user) or `administrator@vsphere.local` |
  | vCenter Server (with embedded PSC) FQDN | `vcenter-<subdomain_label>.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |
  | Single Sign-On (SSO) site name | `<subdomain_label>` |
  | Fully qualified ESXi server name | `<host_prefix><n>.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`, where `<n>` is the sequence of the ESXi server. The maximum length is 50 characters. |

Don't modify any values that are set during instance order or deployment. Doing so can make your instance unusable. For example, if public networking shuts down, if servers and Virtual Server Instances (VSIs) move behind a Vyatta mid-provision, or if the IBM CloudBuilder VSI stops or is deleted.
{:important}

## System settings
{: #vc_orderinginstance-sys-settings}

You must specify the following system settings when you order a vCenter Server instance.

### Instance name
{: #vc_orderinginstance-inst-name}

The instance name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The instance name must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length of the instance name is 10 characters.
* The instance name must be unique within your account.

### Primary or secondary
{: #vc_orderinginstance-primary-secondary}

Select whether to order a new primary instance or a secondary instance for an existing primary instance.

## Licensing settings
{: #vc_orderinginstance-licensing-settings}

Specify the licensing options for the following VMware components in the instance:
* vCenter Server 6.5 - Standard edition
* vSphere 6.5u1 - Enterprise Plus edition
* NSX Service Providers 6.4 (Base, Advanced, or Enterprise edition)

For Business Partner users, the vCenter Server license (Standard edition), the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition), and the NSX license are included and purchased on your behalf. However, you must specify the edition for the NSX license.

For non-Business Partner users, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components by selecting **Include with purchase**, or you can Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license keys.

### Licensing notes
{: #vc_orderinginstance-licensing-notes}

* A license with a minimum of eight CPUs is required, which is for four servers with two CPUs per server. The license choice for each VMware component applies to the base instance and to any ESXi servers that you add to the instance later. Ensure that your license supports future capacity expansion in your infrastructure.
* The minimum license editions are indicated on the user interface. If different component editions are supported, you can select the edition that you want. You are responsible to ensure that the license key provided is correct for each VMware component selected.
* For vSphere, a license charge is incurred at the time of order, but the license charge is then credited to your account.
* You can change any licenses that you provided by using the VMware vSphere Web Client after the instance deployment is completed.
* Support for the VMware components that you provide licenses is provided by VMware, not by IBM Support.

* All strings, except for the last one, can contain only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters.
* The last string can contain only alphabetic characters.
* The length of the last string must be in the range 2 - 24 characters.

The maximum length of the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for hosts and VMs is 50 characters. Domain names must accommodate for this maximum length.
{:note}

### Public or private network
{: #vc_orderinginstance-public-private-network}

Network interface card (NIC) enablement settings are based on your selection of either **Public and Private Network** or **Private Network Only**. The following add-on services require public NICs and are not available if you select the private option:

* F5 on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Security Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Fortigate Virtual Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}

### VLANs
{: #vc_orderinginstance-vlans}

Network settings are based on your selection of either **Order New VLANs** or **Select Existing VLANs**.

One public VLAN and two private VLANs are required for your instance order. The two private VLANs are trunked into each Bare Metal Server.

#### Order New VLANs
{: #vc_orderinginstance-new-vlans}

Select to order one new public VLAN and two new private VLANs.

#### Select Existing VLANs
{: #vc_orderinginstance-existing-vlans}

Depending on the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} that you selected, existing public and private VLANs might be available.

When you select to reuse existing public and private VLANs, specify the VLANs and subnets:
* **Public VLAN** is for public network access.
* **Private VLAN** is for connectivity among the data centers and services within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
* **Secondary private VLAN** is for VMware features such as vSAN.
* **Primary Subnet** is assigned to physical hosts for public network access.
* **Primary Private Subnet** is assigned to physical hosts for management traffic.

Ensure that the firewall configuration on the selected VLANs does not block the management data traffic. Also ensure that all the VLANs that you select are in the same pod. ESXi servers cannot be provisioned on mixed-pod VLANs.
{:important}

### DNS configuration
{: #vc_orderinginstance-dns-config}

Select the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration for your instance:

* **Single Public Windows VSI for Active Directory/DNS**: A single Microsoft Windows Server VSI for Microsoft Active Directory (AD), which functions as the DNS for the instance where the hosts and VMs are registered, is deployed and can be looked up. This option has been deployed by default for V1.9 and later instances.
* **Two highly available dedicated Windows Server VMs on the management cluster**: Two Microsoft Windows VMs are deployed, helping enhance security and robustness.

You must provide two Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 licenses if you configure your instance to use the two Microsoft Windows VMs. Use the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard edition license, or the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter edition license, or both.
{:important}

Each license can be assigned only to one single physical server and covers up to two physical processors. One Standard edition license can run two virtualized Microsoft Windows VMs per 2-processor server. Therefore, two licenses are required since two Microsoft Windows VMs are deployed in two different hosts.

You have 30 days to activate the VMs.

For more information about Windows licensing, see [Windows Server 2012 R2 documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/windows-server-2012-r2.aspx#tab=2).

## Results after you order vCenter Server instances
{: #vc_orderinginstance-results}

The deployment of the instance starts automatically. You receive confirmation that the order is being processed and you can check the status of the deployment by viewing the instance details.

When the instance is successfully deployed, the components that are described in [Technical specifications for vCenter Server instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vcenter?topic=vmware-solutions-vc_vcenterserveroverview#technical-specifications-for-vcenter-server-instances) are installed on your VMware virtual platform. The ESXi servers that you ordered are grouped as **cluster1** by default. If you ordered add-on services, the deployment of the services starts after your order is completed.

When the instance is ready to use, the status of the instance is changed to **Ready to Use** and you receive a notification by email.

When you order a secondary instance, the VMware vSphere Web Client for the primary instance (linked to the secondary one) might be restarted after your secondary instance order is completed.

## What to do next
{: #vc_orderinginstance-next}

View and manage the vCenter Server instance that you ordered.

You must manage the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components that are created in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account	 only from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, not the 	{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, or any other means outside of the console.
If you change these components outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, the changes are not synchronized with the console.
{:important}

**CAUTION:** Managing any {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components (which were installed into your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account	 when you ordered the instance) from outside the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console can make your environment unstable. These management activities include:
*  Adding, modifying, returning, or removing components
*  Expanding or contracting instance capacity through adding or removing ESXi servers
*  Powering off components
*  Restarting services

   Exceptions to these activities include managing the shared storage file shares from the 	{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Such activities include: ordering, deleting (which might impact data stores if mounted), authorizing, and mounting shared storage file shares.
