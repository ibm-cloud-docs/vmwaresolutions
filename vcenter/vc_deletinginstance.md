The instance remains in **Deleting** status and the monthly ESXi servers are available for the remainder of the account monthly billing cycle. After the billing cycle ends, the status of the device changes from **ACTIVE** to **RECLAIM** until the reclaim process completes which can take days or weeks into the following month.

After the ESXi server reclaim process completes, the subnets and VLANs are deleted and the instance deletion is completed.
