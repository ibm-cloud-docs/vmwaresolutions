# Requirements and planning for Cloud Foundation instances

Review the following requirements before you order your VMware Cloud Foundation instances. Plan your instance based on the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent}} location, your workload capacity requirements, and service requirements.

## IBM Cloud account requirements

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account that you are using must meet certain requirements. For more information, see [Requirements for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic/slaccountrequirement.html).

The Cloud Foundation deployment has strict requirements on the physical infrastructure. Therefore, you can deploy instances only in {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} that meet the requirements. The following {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} are available for Cloud Foundation deployment:

## Backup of management components

You are responsible for maintaining and ensuring the availability of all instance components. It is recommended that you plan for backup or high availability of all management components. For more information, see [Backing up components](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/archiref/solution/solution_backingup.html).

## Services for Cloud Foundation instances

You can order add-on services for your instance base on your needs, for example, disaster recovery. For more information, see [Ordering, viewing, and removing services for Cloud Foundation instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/sddc/sd_addingremovingservices.html).

## Capacity considerations

For more information about capacity, see [Scaling capacity](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/archiref/solution/solution_scaling.html).
