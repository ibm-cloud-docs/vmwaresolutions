# Ordering Cloud Foundation instances

To deploy a unified software-defined data center (SDDC) platform with standard compute, storage, and network configuration, order a VMware Cloud Foundation instance. During the initial order, you can also add services, such as [Zerto on IBM Cloud](../services/addingzertodr.html).

When you order a VMware Cloud Foundation instance, an entire VMware environment is deployed automatically. The base deployment consists of four IBM® Cloud bare metal servers with the VMware Cloud Foundation stack preinstalled and configured to provide a unified software-defined data center (SDDC) platform. Cloud Foundation natively integrates VMware vSphere, VMware NSX, VMware Virtual SAN, and is architected based on VMware Validated Designs.

## Requirements

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
*  You configured the IBM Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [User accounts and settings](../vmonic/useraccount.html).
*  You meet the requirements and you reviewed the considerations in [Cloud Foundation requirements](sd_planning.html).

## Settings

When you order a Cloud Foundation instance, you must specify the following settings.

**Important: Do not modify any values that are set during ordering and instance deployment. Doing so can result in your instance becoming unusable. In addition, do not change the instance name or the domain name after the instance is deployed.**

### Instance type

You can deploy the instance as a primary (single) instance in your environment, or deploy the instance in a multi-site configuration by linking it with an existing primary instance for high availability. For more information, see [Multi-site configuration for Cloud Foundation instances](sd_multisite.html).

### Domain name

The root domain name must meet the following requirements:
*  The name must consist of two or more strings that are separated by period (.)
*  Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
*  Each string must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character, and the last string can contain only alphabetic characters.
*  The length of the last string must be in the range 2 - 24 characters.
*  The length of other strings must be in the range 1 - 63 characters.
*  The maximum length of the domain name is 189 characters.

### Instance name

The instance name must meet the following requirements:
*  Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
*  The instance name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
*  The maximum length of the instance name is 10 characters.
*  The instance name must be unique within your account.

### Instance and domain name format

The Cloud Foundation instance name and the root domain name use the format in the following table.

Table 1. Value format for instance and domain names

| Name        | Value Format      |
  |:------------- |:------------- |
  | Domain name | `rootdomain` |  
  | Fully qualified ESXi host name | `hostn.instancename.rootdomain`, where n is the sequence of the ESXi server. The maximum length is 50 characters. |   
  | vCenter Server login user name | `userid@rootdomain` (Microsoft Active Directory user) or `administrator@vsphere.local` |
  | vCenter Server fully qualified domain name (FQDN) | `vcenter-1.instancename.rootdomain` |  
  | SDDC Manager FQDN name | `sddcmanager.instancename.rootdomain`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |
  | Single Sign-On (SSO) site name | `instancename`
  | Fully qualified ESXi host name | `hostn.instancename.rootdomain`, where n is the sequence of the ESXi server. The maximum length is 50 characters. |
  | PSC fully qualified FQDN name | `PSC-instancename.rootdomain`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |  

  The SDDC Manager FQDN cannot be publicly resolvable. Otherwise, the Cloud Foundation instance configuration fails and is not recoverable.
  Before you specify a domain name, review [Considerations when choosing a root domain name](../vmonic/trbl_limitations.html#considerations-when-choosing-a-root-domain-name-for-cloud-foundation-instances).

### Bare metal server configuration

You can select a bare metal server specification depending on your requirements:
* Standard (Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.60 GHz / 256 GB RAM / 12 disks)
* Small (Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.20 GHz / 128 GB RAM / 12 disks)
* User customized: you can specify the CPU model and RAM for the bare metal server

Table 2. CPU and RAM options for the user customized configuration

| Item          | Options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| CPU | <ul><li>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.10 GHz</li><li>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.20 GHz</li><li>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.60 GHz</li></ul>|
| RAM | 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB

For guidance on what option to choose, see the _Bill of Materials_ document in the [Architecture Center](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/architecture/virtCloudFoundationPlatform){:new_window}.

### Data center location

You must select the IBM® Cloud data center where the instance is to be hosted. Only the data centers that meet the bare metal server specification are displayed.

## Services

When you order a Cloud Foundation instance, you can also order additional services. For more information about the available services, see [Services for Cloud Foundation instances](sd_planning.html#services-for-cloud-foundation-instances).

## Procedure

1. Click **Getting Started** or **Order Instance** from the left navigation pane.
2. On the **Cloud Foundation** card, click **Order Instance**.

   *  To deploy a single instance in the environment or to deploy the first instance in a multi-site topology, click **Primary**.
   *  To connect the instance with an existing (primary) instance in the environment for high availability, click **Secondary**.
4. On the **Basics** page, specify the required information based on the instance type you selected.

   If you selected the **Primary** instance type, provide the following information :
     1. Enter the root domain name.
     2. Enter the instance name.
     3. Select the bare metal server specification.
     4. If you selected **User customized** for the bare metal server configuration, specify the **CPU Model** and the amount of **RAM**.
     5. Select the IBM Cloud data center to host the instance.
     6. Click **Next**.

   If you selected the **Secondary** instance type, provide the following information:
     1. Select the primary site that you want the instance to be connected with.
     2. Review the root domain name that is automatically filled in.
     3. Enter the instance name.
     4. Select the bare metal server specification.
     5. If you selected **User customized** for the bare metal server configuration, specify the **CPU Model** and the amount of **RAM**.
     6. Select the IBM Cloud data center to host the instance.
     7. Click **Next**.

5. If you selected the **Secondary** instance type, review the following information on the **Primary instance authentication** page:
   1. In the **Primary Instance PSC Administrator Password** field, the Platform Services Controller (PSC) password of the selected
   primary instance is automatically filled in.
   2. Click **Next** to verify the password.
   3. If the password validation fails, enter the correct PSC password, and click **Next** again.

6. On the **Add Service** page, complete the following steps:
   1. To deploy a service into your instance, click **Select Service** on the corresponding service card.
   2. If you accepted the default selection for Veeam on IBM Cloud, specify the following settings in the **Configure Veeam** area:
      * **Number of VMs to License**: A minimum of 4 VMs for licenses is required for management.
      * **Storage Size**: The capacity that meets your storage needs. A minimum of 2,000 GB of storage is required for management. For considerations when estimating storage size, see [Estimating Repository Capacity](https://bp.veeam.expert/resource_planning/repository_planning_sizing.html).
      * **Storage Performance**: The IOPS (Input/output Operations Per Second) per GB based on your workload requirements.
  3. If you want to install F5 on IBM Cloud, specify the following settings in the **Configure F5 on IBM Cloud** area:
     * **License Model**: Select **Good**, **Better**, or **Best** according to your requirements. For more information about what is provided for each license option, click **Learn More** on the **F5 on IBM Cloud** service card.
     * **Maximum Bandwidth**:  The maximum data transfer rate for the network connection.
  4. Select any other services that you want to install, or, to proceed without deploying any service, including Veeam on IBM Cloud, click **Selected Service** on the service card. Click **Next**.

7. On the **Licensing** page, specify the licensing choice for each of the VMware components of the instance you are ordering, including vCenter Server, vSphere, NSX, and vSAN:
   * If you want new licenses to be purchased on your behalf, select **Include with purchase** for the components, and then click
   **Next**.
   * If you want to use your own VMware license for a component, select **I will provide**, enter the license key string for the component, and then click **Next**.

   **Attention**:
   * Only one license choice is supported for each VMware component. Both purchasing and providing licenses for the same VMware
   component is not supported. The license choice selected for a VMware component applies for the life of the instance.
   * A license with a minimum of 8 CPUs is required, which is for 4 servers with 2 CPUs per server. The license choice for each VMware
   component applies to the base instance and to any ESXi servers that you add to the instance later. Therefore, you must ensure that
   your license supports future capacity expansion in your infrastructure.
   * The minimum license editions required are vCenter Server Standard, vSphere Enterprise Plus, NSX Enterprise, and vSAN Standard. You
   are responsible for ensuring the license key is for the proper edition of the VMware component.
   * For vSphere, a license charge will be incurred at time of order, but the license charge will subsequently be credited to your
   account.
   * You can change any licenses that you have provided by using the VMware vSphere Web Client after the instance deployment is
   completed.
   * Support for the VMware components that you provide licenses for will be directly provided by VMware, not by IBM Support.

8. On the **Summary** page, verify the instance configuration before you place the order.
   1. Review the settings for the instance.
   2. Click the link or links of the terms that apply to your order, and ensure that you agree with these terms before you order the
   instance.
   3. Review the estimated cost of the instance by clicking the price link under **Estimated Cost**. To save or print your order
   summary, click the **Print** or **Download** icon on the upper right of the PDF window.
   4. Click **Place Order**.

## Results

The deployment of the instance starts automatically. You receive confirmation that the order is being processed and you can check the status of the deployment by viewing the instance details.

When the instance is successfully deployed, the components that are described in [Cloud Foundation instance  components](../sddc/sd_cloudfoundationoverview.html#cloud-foundation-components) are installed on your VMware virtual platform. If you ordered additional services, the deployment of the services is started after your order is completed.

When the instance is ready to use, the status of the instance is changed to **Ready to Use** and you receive a notification by email.

## What to do next

View and manage the Cloud Foundation instance that you ordered.

**Important**: You must manage the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} components that are created in your Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) account only from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, not the Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) portal or any other means outside of the console. If you change these components outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, the changes are not synchronized with the console.

**CAUTION**: Managing any {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components (which were installed into your Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) account when you ordered the instance) from outside the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console can make your environment unstable. These management activities include:

*  Adding, modifying, returning, or removing components
*  Expanding or contracting instance capacity through adding or removing ESXi servers
*  Powering off components
*  Restarting services

   Exceptions to these activities include managing the shared storage file shares from the Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) portal. Such activities include: ordering, deleting (which might impact data stores if mounted), authorizing, and mounting shared storage file shares.
