# Ordering Cloud Foundation instances
{: #sd_orderinginstance}

To deploy a unified software-defined data center (SDDC) platform with standard compute, storage, and network configuration, order a VMware Cloud Foundation instance. During the initial order, you can also add services, such as [Zerto on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/services?topic=vmware-solutions-addingzertodr) for disaster recovery.

## Requirements
{: #sd_orderinginstance-req}

Ensure that you completed the following tasks:
*  You configured the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure credentials on the **Settings** page. For more information, see [Managing user accounts and settings](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-useraccount).
*  You reviewed the requirements and considerations in [Requirements and planning for Cloud Foundation instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/sddc?topic=vmware-solutions-sd_planning).

Don't modify any values that are set during instance order or deployment. Doing so can make your instance unusable. For example, if public networking shuts down, if servers and Virtual Server Instances (VSIs) move behind a Vyatta mid-provision, or if the IBM CloudBuilder VSI stops or is deleted. In addition, do not change the instance name, root domain name, subdomain label, or host name prefix, after the instance is deployed.
{:important}

## System settings
{: #sd_orderinginstance-sys-settings}

You must specify the following system settings when you order a Cloud Foundation instance.

### Instance name
{: #sd_orderinginstance-inst-name}

The instance name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The instance name must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length of the instance name is 10 characters.
* The instance name must be unique within your account.

### Primary or secondary
{: #sd_orderinginstance-primary-secondary}

Select whether to order a new primary instance or a secondary instance for an existing primary instance.

## Licensing settings
{: #sd_orderinginstance-licensing-settings}

Specify the licensing options for the following VMware components in the instance:  
* vCenter Server License - Standard
* vSphere License - Enterprise Plus
* NSX License - Enterprise
* vSAN License: select the Advanced or Enterprise edition

For Business Partner users, the vCenter Server license (Standard edition), the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition), the NSX license, and the vSAN license are included and purchased on your behalf. However, you must specify the edition for the vSAN license.

For non-Business Partner users, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for these components by selecting **Include with purchase**, or you can Bring Your Own License (BYOL) by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license keys.

## Bare Metal Server settings
{: #sd_orderinginstance-bare-metal}

### Data center location
{: #sd_orderinginstance-dc-location}

Select the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} where the instance is to be hosted.

### Number of Bare Metal Servers
{: #sd_orderinginstance-bare-metal-number}

A Cloud Foundation instance comprises four Bare Metal Severs at the initial deployment. You cannot change the number of Bare Metal Servers when you place the order.

## Storage settings
{: #sd_orderinginstance-storage}

For Cloud Foundation instances, you can order VMware vSAN storage only.

When you select the **Skylake** or **Broadwell** Bare Metal Server configuration, you can customize the vSAN storage for your instance. Specify the following vSAN settings:
* **Disk Type and Size for vSAN Capacity Disks**: Select an option for the capacity disks that you need.
* **Number of vSAN Capacity Disks**: Specify the number of capacity disks that you want to add.
* If you want to add capacity disks over the limit of eight, check the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box. This option provides two extra capacity disk bays for a total of 10 capacity disks and is useful for workloads that require less latency and higher IOPS throughput.

  The **High-Performance Intel Optane** option is available only for the Skylake CPU models Dual Intel Xeon Gold 5120 and Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6140.
  {:note}

* Review the **Disk Type for vSAN Cache Disks** and **Number of vSAN Cache Disks** values. These values depend on whether you checked the **High-Performance Intel Optane** box.

## Network interface settings
{: #sd_orderinginstance-network-interface}

You must specify the following network interface settings when you order a Cloud Foundation instance.

### Hostname prefix
{: #sd_orderinginstance-hostname-prefix}

The host name prefix must meet the following requirements:
*  Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
*  The host name prefix must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
*  The maximum length of the host name prefix is 10 characters.

### Subdomain label
{: #sd_orderinginstance-subdomain-label}

The subdomain label must meet the following requirements:
*  Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
*  The subdomain label must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character.
*  The maximum length of the subdomain label is 10 characters.
*  The subdomain label must be unique within your account.

### Domain name
{: #sd_orderinginstance-domain-name}

The root domain name must meet the following requirements:
* The domain name must consist of two or more strings that are separated by period (.)
* The first string must start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character.
* All strings, except for the last one, can contain only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters.
* The last string can contain only alphabetic characters.
* The length of the last string must be in the range 2 - 24 characters.

The maximum length of the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) for hosts and VMs (virtual machines) is 50 characters. Domain names must accommodate for this maximum length.
{:note}

### Value format for network settings
{: #sd_orderinginstance-network-settings-value-format}

The domain name and subdomain label are used to generate the user name and server names of the instance, as shown in the following table.

Table 3. Value format for user names, domain names, and server names

| Name        | Value Format      |
  |:------------- |:------------- |
  | Domain name | `<root_domain>` |  
  | Fully qualified ESXi server name | `<host_prefix><n>.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`, where `<n>` is the sequence of the ESXi server. The maximum length is 50 characters. |   
  | vCenter Server login user name | `<user_id>@<root_domain>` (Microsoft Active Directory user) or `administrator@vsphere.local` |
  | vCenter Server FQDN | `vcenter-1.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |  
  | SDDC Manager FQDN | `sddcmanager.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |
  | Single Sign-On (SSO) site name | `<subdomain_label>`
  | PSC FQDN | `PSC-<subdomain_label>.<subdomain_label>.<root_domain>`. The maximum length is 50 characters. |  

  The SDDC Manager FQDN cannot be publicly resolvable. Otherwise, the Cloud Foundation instance configuration might fail and is not recoverable. Before you specify a domain name, review [Considerations when choosing a root domain name](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_limitations#considerations-when-choosing-a-root-domain-name-for-cloud-foundation-instances).

### VLANs
{: #sd_orderinginstance-vlans}

Network settings are based on your selection of either **Order New VLANs** or **Select Existing VLANs**.

One public VLAN and two private VLANs are required for your instance order. The two private VLANs are trunked into each Bare Metal Server.

#### Order New VLANs
{: #sd_orderinginstance-new-vlans}

Select to order one new public VLAN and two new private VLANs.

#### Select Existing VLANs
{: #sd_orderinginstance-existing-vlans}

Depending on the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} that you selected, existing public and private VLANs might be available.

When you select to reuse existing public and private VLANs, specify the VLANs and subnets:
  * **Public VLAN** is for public network access.
  * **Private VLAN** is for connectivity among the data centers and services within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
  * **Secondary Private VLAN** is for VMware features such as vSAN.
  * **Primary Subnet** is assigned to physical hosts for public network access.
  * **Private Primary Subnet** is assigned to physical hosts for management traffic.

Ensure that the firewall configuration on the selected VLANs does not block the management data traffic. Ensure that all of the VLANs you select are in the same pod because ESXi servers cannot be provisioned on mixed-pod VLANs.
{:important}

## Services
{: #sd_orderinginstance-addon-services}

When you order a Cloud Foundation instance, you can also order add-on services. For more information about the available services, see [Services for Cloud Foundation instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/sddc?topic=vmware-solutions-sd_planning#services-for-cloud-foundation-instances).

    5. Click **Provision**.

## Results
{: #sd_orderinginstance-results}

The deployment of the instance starts automatically. You receive confirmation that the order is being processed and you can check the status of the deployment by viewing the instance details.

When the instance is successfully deployed, the components that are described in [Technical specifications for Cloud Foundation instances](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/sddc?topic=vmware-solutions-sd_cloudfoundationoverview#technical-specifications-for-cloud-foundation-instances) are installed on your VMware virtual platform. The ESXi servers that you ordered are grouped as **SDDC-Cluster** by default. If you ordered add-on  services, the deployment of the services starts after your order is completed.

When the instance is ready to use, the status of the instance is changed to **Ready to Use** and you receive a notification by email.

When you order a secondary instance, the VMware vSphere Web Client for the primary instance (linked to the secondary one) might be restarted after your secondary instance order is completed.

## What to do next
{: #sd_orderinginstance-next}

View and manage the Cloud Foundation instance that you ordered.

You must manage the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components that are created in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account only from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, not the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, or any other means outside of the console. If you change these components outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, the changes are not synchronized with the console.
{:important}

**CAUTION:** Managing any {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} components (which were installed into your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account when you ordered the instance) from outside the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console can make your environment unstable. These management activities include:

*  Adding, modifying, returning, or removing components
*  Expanding or contracting instance capacity through adding or removing ESXi servers
*  Powering off components
*  Restarting services

   Exceptions to these activities include managing the shared storage file shares from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Such activities include: ordering, deleting (which might impact data stores if mounted), authorizing, and mounting shared storage file shares.
