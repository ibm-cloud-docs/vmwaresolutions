# Expanding and contracting capacity for Cloud Foundation instances
{: #sd_addingremovingservers}

You can expand or contract the capacity of your VMware Cloud Foundation instance according to your business needs, by adding or removing ESXi servers.

A Cloud Foundation instance can have up to five clusters, one of which is the default. Each initial cluster can have up to 51 ESXi servers and more clusters can have up to 59.

## Adding ESXi servers to Cloud Foundation instances
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-adding}

### Before you add ESXi servers
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-adding-prereq}

* Do not add ESXi servers from the VMware vSphere Web Client. The changes that you make on the VMware vSphere Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console.
* The base platform that you ordered has 4 ESXi servers by default. You can expand the platform to a maximum of 32 ESXi servers. However, the number of the {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} that you can add at a time is as follows:
   * For the **Small** and **Large** configuration, you can add 1 - 10 ESXi servers at a time.
   * For the **Skylake** and **Broadwell** configuration, you can add 1 - 20 ESXi servers at a time.

## Procedure to add ESXi servers
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-adding-procedure}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Resources** on the left navigation pane.
2. In the **Cloud Foundation Instances** table, click the instance for which you want to expand capacity.
3. Click **Infrastructure** on the left navigation pane.
4. In the **CLUSTERS** table, click the cluster to which you want to add ESXi servers.
5. In the **ESXi Servers** section, click **Add**.
6. In the **Add Server** window, enter the number of servers that you want to add, review the estimated cost, and then click **Add**.

### Results after you add ESXi servers
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-adding-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console while the instance status changes from **Ready to Use** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to fully complete before you make additional changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email when your ESXi servers are added.
3. If you do not see the new ESXi servers added to the list in the cluster, check the email or console notifications to find more details about the failure.

## Removing ESXi servers from Cloud Foundation instances
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-removing}

### Before you remove ESXi servers
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-removing-prereq}

* Do not remove ESXi servers from the VMware vSphere Web Client. The changes that you make on the VMware vSphere Web Client are not synchronized with the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console.
* The base platform that you ordered has 4 ESXi servers by default. You can remove the ESXi servers that you added. You cannot remove the default ESXi servers.
* Before you remove ESXi servers with the F5 on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or FortiGate Virtual Appliance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service installed, you must migrate the F5 BIG-IP and FortiGate VMs to a different ESXi server than the one that is hosting the VMs.
* Before you remove ESXi servers with the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service installed, ensure that no backup or restore operations are active. Active operations, either failed or in progress, might prevent the ESXi servers to be removed.

## Procedure to remove ESXi servers
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-removing-procedure}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Resources** on the left navigation pane.
2. In the **Cloud Foundation Instances** table, click the instance for which you want to contract capacity.
3. Click **Infrastructure** on the left navigation pane.
4. In the **CLUSTERS** table, click the cluster from which you want to remove ESXi servers.
6. In the **ESXi Servers** section, select the servers that you want to remove and click **Remove**.

### Results after you remove ESXi servers
{: #sd_addingremovingservers-removing-results}

1. You might experience a slight delay on the console while the instance status changes from **Ready to Use** to **Modifying**. Allow the operation to fully complete before you make more changes to the instance.
2. You are notified by email when your ESXi servers are removed.
3. The ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure at the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} billing cycle, which is typically 30 days.

   You are billed until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} billing cycle for the removed ESXi servers.
