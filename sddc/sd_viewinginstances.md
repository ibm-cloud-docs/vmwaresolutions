## Procedure to view access information for Cloud Foundation instances
{: #sd_viewinginstances-procedure-view-access-info}

Under **Access Information**, view the access information for the instance-related components. The passwords that are displayed are initial passwords that are generated by the system. If you change them outside of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, they are not updated on the instance summary page.

## What to do if errors occur
{: #sd_viewinginstances-if-errors-occur}

If errors occur during instance deployment or instance deletion, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support team is automatically notified. To inquire about the status of your ticket, you can [contact IBM Support](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_support).

## What to do next
{: #sd_viewinginstances-next}

Manage your instances from the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console or the vSphere Web Client.

Before you click **vCenter console** on the instance summary page to go to the vSphere Web Client and start managing your ESXi servers, you must log in to the VPN portal of the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}}. Hover over the vCenter console button and follow the instructions to ensure that you meet all requirements and you completed the necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client.
{:important}

Review the following topics for information to help you complete the login instructions:

* For the requirements and necessary steps before you access the vSphere Web Client, see [Timeout reached while connecting to the vSphere Web Client](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_timeout_vc_console).
* For a list of access points to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Network by using VPN, see [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access){:new_window}.
* If you have problems when you deploy an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) file by using the vSphere Web Client, see [Deploying an OVF file by using the vSphere Web Client](/docs/services/vmwaresolutions/vmonic?topic=vmware-solutions-trbl_deploy_ovf).
