# Deleting Cloud Foundation instances

To release the components that you ordered in a VMware Cloud Foundation instance, you can delete the instance.

When you delete a Cloud Foundation instance, the following components are released sequentially:
1. All deployed services
2. Support and Services fee
3. VMware product licenses
4. ESXi servers
5. Subnets
6. VLANs

Because of resource dependencies, the components in your instance are not released immediately when you delete the instance. For example, the subnets and VLANs cannot be deleted until the ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by IBM Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer), which happens at the end of the Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) billing cycle. At the end of the Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) billing cycle, which is typically 30 days, the subnets and VLANs are deleted and the instance deletion is completed.

**Attention**: You are billed until the end of the Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) billing cycle for the deleted instance.
