# Adding, viewing, and deleting clusters for Cloud Foundation instances

The ESXi servers that you configured when you ordered an instance are grouped under a default cluster. The default cluster name is:
* For instances that were deployed in V2.1 or later releases: **MGMT-Cluster-`<subdomain_label>`**
* For instances that were deployed in V2.0 or earlier releases: **SDDC-Cluster**

You can add your own clusters to VMware Cloud Foundation instances to expand the compute and storage capacity. Within a cluster, you can manage ESXi servers for better resource allocation and high availability. When no longer needed, you can delete the added clusters from your instances.

**Availability**:
* The add cluster feature is available only to instances that were deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.0 and later releases.
* The delete cluster feature is available only to instances that are deployed in (or upgraded to) V2.3 and later releases.  

## Adding clusters to Cloud Foundation instances

You can add up to five clusters to a Cloud Foundation instance.

### System settings

When you add a cluster to a Cloud Foundation instance, you must specify the following settings.

#### Cluster name

The cluster name must meet the following requirements:
* Only alphanumeric and dash (-) characters are allowed.
* The cluster name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
* The maximum length of the cluster name is 30 characters.
* The cluster name must be unique within the Cloud Foundation instance.

#### Data center location

The {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent}} location of the cluster is set to the {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} of the Cloud Foundation instance by default. You can deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent_notm}} than the deployed instance, but you must ensure that the network latency between the two {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} is less than 150 ms. To check the network latency, you can use a tool such as [SoftLayer IP Backbone Looking Glass](http://lg.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.

The data centers available to you depend on the Bare Metal Server configuration selected for deployment. If you select the **Customized** configuration, you can also deploy the cluster to a different {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure pod, if the selected data center contains additional pods. This is useful when the default {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure pod where the initial instance is deployed has reached its maximum capacity.

**Note:** The standardized **Small** and **Large** Bare Metal Server configurations use a default pod that cannot be changed.

If you deploy the cluster to a different data center or pod, three additional VLANs are ordered for use with the ordered {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

### Bare Metal settings

You can choose **Customized** or **Preconfigured**.

#### Customized

For the **Customized** setting, you have a number of option for the **CPU Model** and **RAM**.

Table 1. Options for customized {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}

| CPU options   | RAM options   |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz | 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz | 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, 512 GB, 768 GB, 1.5 TB |

#### Preconfigured

For the **Preconfigured** setting, you can choose a **Bare Metal Server Configuration** depending on your requirements:
* Small (Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz / 128 GB RAM / 12 disks)
* Large (Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz / 512 GB RAM / 12 disks)

**Note:** The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure provides an automatic and free upgrade to your CPU model if the configuration that you order is not available. The following table identifies the possible upgrade scenarios.

Table 2. Possible CPU model upgrade options

| Ordered CPU        | Automatic CPU upgrade options       |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 / 16 cores total, 2.1 GHz | Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz<br><br>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz |
| Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 / 24 cores total, 2.2 GHz | Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 / 28 cores total, 2.6 GHz |

### vSAN storage settings

For the **Preconfigured** Bare Metal Server configurations, you cannot change the vSAN storage settings:
* For the **Small** configuration, two disk drives of 1.9 TB SSD SED are ordered.
* For the **Large** configuration, four disk drives of 3.8 TB SSD SED are ordered.

For the **Customized** Bare Metal Server configuration, you can customize the vSAN storage by specifying the number of vSAN capacity disks, the disk type and size that meet your storage needs.

### Licenses settings

You can specify the licensing options for the VMware components in the cluster, including VMware vSphere and VMware vSAN:
* For Business Partner users, the vSphere license (Enterprise Plus edition) and the vSAN license are included and purchased on your behalf. However, you must specify the edition for the vSAN license.
* For non-Business Partner users, you can use the IBM-provided VMware licenses for the components by selecting **Include with purchase**, or you can Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for the components by selecting **I will provide** and entering your own license keys.

## Deleting clusters from Cloud Foundation instances

You might want to delete a cluster from an instance when it is no longer needed.

### Before you delete

* Use this procedure to delete clusters from instances that are deployed in V2.3 or later releases.
* For clusters deployed in V2.2 or earlier instances, you must upgrade the instance to V2.3 to be able to delete the clusters that you added to the instance.
* You can delete a single cluster at a time. To delete multiple clusters, you must do it in sequence; waiting for the previous cluster to be deleted before you attempt to delete the next cluster.
* Ensure that all nodes in a cluster are powered on and operational before deleting the cluster.
* When you delete a cluster, all VMs (virtual machines) from the cluster will also be deleted and they cannot be recovered. If you want to keep the VMs, migrate them to other clusters.
* The default cluster cannot be deleted.

## Procedure to delete clusters from Cloud Foundation instances

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Deployed Instances** on the left navigation pane.
2. In the **Cloud Foundation instances** table, click the instance that you want to delete clusters from.

   **Note**: Ensure that the instance is in the **Ready to Use** status. Otherwise, you cannot delete clusters from the instance.

3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab. In the **CLUSTERS** table, locate the cluster that you want to delete and click the **Delete** icon.
4. Confirm that you completed the migration of VMs to other clusters, if appropriate, and that you want to delete the cluster.
